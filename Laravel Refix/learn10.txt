If we need to work with thousands of database records, we may make use of the chunk() method, this method retrieves a small chunk of the results each time
and feeds each into a closure for processing. We may also stop other chunks from being processed by returning false

The query builder also provides a variety of aggregate methods such as count, max, min, avg and sum. You may call any of these methods after constructing your query

Instead of making use of the count() method to check if any records exists that match your query's constraints, we may make use of the exists and doesntExist method

Using the select() method, we may specify a custom select clause for the query

The distinct() method allows us to force the query to return distinct results
