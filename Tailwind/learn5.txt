By default, tailwind will look for a tailwind.config.js in the root of your project where we can define any customizations.

The theme section is where you define your color palette, font stacks, type scale, border sizes, breakpoints , anything related to the visual design
of your site

The themes.screens key is where we specify the configuration of our responsiveness.

The theme object contains keys for screens, colors and spacing.	
The whole idea of customization is that we can specify the color values that are adopted by the our color classes. 

If we would like to preserve the default values for a theme option but would also like to add new values, we can do so under a theme.extends key

The Container refers to a component for fixing an element's width to the current breakpoint
