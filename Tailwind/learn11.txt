Breaking it down
In Tailwind when we append the classes, .grid, .grid-cols-3. It means that we intend to have 3 equally sized columns in each row of the grid. 
We can also specify the order and the start/end of the grids. If we have the .grid-cols-6 class, it means that for an element in the grid to take up the full
width of the grid, it must have a class of col-span-6. We can also specify where the grid would start with col-start and col-end

CSS grid lines start at 1, not 0. So a full width element in a .grid-cols-6 class, would start at line 1 and end at line 7.

The main difference I have seen is that with grid-cols, it flows to the side but with grid-row it flows to the bottom.

By default, Tailwind provides support for .grid-rows up to 6 rows as opposed to 12 with .grid-cols
With .grid-row, we make use of .row-span instead of .col-span

Gaps are utilities for controlling gutters between grid rows and columns. It is carried out in increments of 0.25rem
To change or set the gap in all directions i.e both x and y axes, we need to make use of the .gap.

For row gap, we need to make use of the .row-gap while for column gap, we make use of the .col-gap
