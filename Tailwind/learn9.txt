Align Self
Utilities for controlling how an individual flex item is positioned along its container's cross axis.
The way I see it is that in a flex container, we can make use of the align self utility to position an individual element.

.self-auto
.self-start
.self-end
.self-center
.self-stretch

Justify Content
These are utilities for controlling how flex items are positioned along a container's main axis.
.justify-start
.justify-between
.justify-end
.justify-center
.justify-around

Grid Template Columns
Utilities for specifying the columns in a grid layout
.grid-cols-1 - .grid-cols-12

Working with responsive code in Tailwind works differently than in Bootstrap. In Bootstrap, we literaly have to write out all the containers.
In Tailwind, what we do is that we specify grid-col-n to generate n columns of the same size.

Grid Column Start/End
.col-auto
.col-span-1
.col-span-2
.col-span-3

I think I understand it. We make use of the col-span attribute to indicate how much of the grid we want the column to take.
We can make use of the col-start attribute to specify where we want our column to start from
