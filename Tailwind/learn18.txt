The whole idea is that Tailwind provides several utilities for working with css transitions

.transition-none
.transition-all
.transition - border-color, background-color, color, stroke, fill, opacity, transform, box-shadow
.transition-colors - border-color, background-color, stroke, fill
.transition-opacity - opacity
.transition-shadow - box-shadow
.transition-transform - transform

For transition duration, Tailwind also has several utilities such as .duration-75, .duration-100, .duration-150,
.duration-200, .duration-300 , .duration-500, .duration-700, .duration-1000

Also for transition timing, we also have .ease-linear, .ease-in, .ease-out, .ease-in-out
