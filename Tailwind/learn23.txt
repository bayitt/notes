Plugins let you register new styles for Tailwind to inject into the user's stylesheet using Javascript instead of CSS.

The presets option lets you specify a different configuration to use as your base, making it easy to package a set of customizations that you'd like to reuse across projects. If you want
to erase the default configuration and start afresh, simply set presets to an empty array.
