Pipes run inside the exception zone. This means that when a pipe throws an exception, it is handled by the exceptions layer (global exceptions filter and any exception filters) that
are applied in the current context.

Nest comes with eight pipes out of the box
- ValidationPipe
- ParseIntPipe
- ParseFloatPipe
- ParseBoolPipe
- ParseArrayPipe
- ParseUUIDPipe
- ParseEnumPipe
- DefaultValuePipe

They are all exported from the @nestjs/common pipe
