Simply put, Nest JS provides decorators for all of the supported HTTP methods, 
- @GET
- @POST
- @PUT
- @PATCH
- @DELETE
- @ALL

Http Status codes are always 200 by default, except for POST requests which are 201, but we can easily customize this with the @HttpCode decorator.
To specify a custom header, we can either make use of the @Header decorator or a library specific implementation and call the res.send

We can also make use of the @Redirect() decorator and specify the redirect destination and the status code, if the redirect is going to be dynamically determined, we can return 
an object with the url and the statusCode from the object. Just like with React, we can make use of : to indicate paths with dynamic parameters
