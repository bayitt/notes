.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python, tuples are written with ()

Since, tuples are unchangeable, we cannot append(), extend(), remove() or pop() like we can do with lists. Instead, the only thing we can do is to
delete the tuple completely by making use of the del operator

Then, we can also make use of the tuple() constructor to make a tuple

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed

We can also make use of the get() method called on a dictionary and pasing in the key, to return its value

We can make use of the values() method. Then, we can make use of the items() method, to return both keys and values in the dictionary

We can make use of the pop() method to remove an item from a dictionary

popitem() removes the last inserted item

Much in the same way that clear() and del work with lists, we can make use of it with dictionaries

Rememeber Leke, dict() method != dict() constructor

A lambda function is a small, anonymous function. A lambda function can take a number of arguments, but can have only one expression.

By default, the expression is returned

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods

Classes in Python are created with the class keyword

In order to create objects in Python, just create a variable and assign it to the class, but unlike in PHP and Javascript, there is no new keyword before
the class name

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated

Note: When creating the __init__() method. ALWAYS make sure to put self, as the first parameter

Leke in every method in which you want to access the current class instance, you need to manually pass in the self instance

We can also delete objects by making use of the del keyword
