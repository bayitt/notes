Leke take note that anytime you use 2 slashes in division, it rounds down the result

The pow() method is also used to find a number and its exponent

Using the r flag in the print() function means that the interpreter should ignore any special notations in the string 

Also, Leke take note that you can also multiply strings in Python

You can access substrings from a string by making use of the [] notation much like accessing array indexes

Python also has something called negative indexes, with the index -1, you an access the last character in a string 

You can access a substring by using [f:e] index. If you name[2:6]. It will start from the character with index 2 and stop at the character with index 5k

The len() method is used to get the length of a string  

I think lists are the Python equivalent of arrays

Much in the same way that we concatenate strings, we can also concatenate lists

The append() method is the Python equivalent to push() in PHP and Javascript

Leek drum it into your head that Python uses : for blocks of code

Leke REMEMBER that with Python, you can just use the 'or' and 'and' keywords like that

I think that with Python, you need to get rid of the normal notation that you use with other languages like ==, || and &&

Instead, you need to use is, or and and

Also, the in keyword is used to check if a value is present in a list
