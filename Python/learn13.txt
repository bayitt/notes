More examples of Non Paramteric Machine Learning Algorithms are 
- Decision Trees like CART and C4.5
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks


Benefits of Non Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms
- Flexibility 
- Power - No assumptions about the underlying function
- Performance - Can result in higher performance models for prediction

Limitations
More data - Requires a lot more training data
Slower -
Overfitting

The types of supervised learning problems are classification and regression problems

Some common types of problems built on top of classification and regression include recommendation and time series prediction

Linear Regression
Random Forest for classification and regression
Support Vector Machines for classification problems

Unsupervised learning is where you have only one input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the
underlying structure or distribution of the data in order to learn more about the data. It is divided into clustering and association.

Clustering is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour
Assoication is where we want to discover rules that govern large portions of our data, such as people that buy A also tend to buy B

K-means algorithm for clustering problems
Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems
