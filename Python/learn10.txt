A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module called datetime to work with dates

In order to access the current datetime in Python, what we need to do is to call datetime.datetime.now()

In order to create a date object to work with, we need to use the datetime class constructor of the datetime module.
The constructor takes three parameters, year, montjhj, day 

The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings

Python has a built in package called json, which can be used for working with JSON data

The json.loads() method is used to convert json to a Python dictionary

In order to do the opposite, convert a Python dictionary to json, use the json.dumps() method

Anytime you convert from Python to JSON, all Python objects are converted into their JSON(Javascript) equivalents

Use the additional indent parameter to define the number of indents in a JSON conversion

We can also specify the sort_keys method to sort alphabetically the result of json.dumps()

pip install package
pip uninstall package
pip list
