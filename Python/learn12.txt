Parametric algorithms involve two steps

1) Select a form for the function
2) Learn the coefficients of the function from the training data

Assuming the functional form of a line greatly simplifies the learning process. The whole idea really is that we select a form of the function that we want
and this function already has its known parameters and what it needs

Often the assumed functional form is a linear combination of the input variables and as such parametric machine learning algorithms are often called
linear machine learning algorithms

The problem with parametric learning algorithms, the actual unknown underlying function may not be a linear functio like a line. It could be almost a line
and require some minor transformationof the input data to work right. Or it could be nothing like a line in which case the assumption s wrong
and the approach will produce poor results.

Some examples of Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Perceptron

Benefits of Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms are 
- They are simpler
- They are faster
- They require less data and can work well even if the data is not to the best fit

Limitations of Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms are
- Constrained 
- Limited Complexity
- Poor Fit

Non Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms
Algorithms that do not make strong assumptions about the form of the mapping function are called non parametric machine learning algorithms By not making
asumptions, they are free to learn any functional form from the training data

Non parametric methods are good when you have a lot of data and no prior knowledge, and when you dont want to worry too much about choosing just the right
features

Non paramateric methods seek to best fit the training data in constructing the mapping form, whilst maintaining some ability to generalize unseen dat. As such, 
they are able to fit a large number of functional forms
