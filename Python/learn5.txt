Algorithms

An algorithm specifies a series of steps that perform a particular computation or task

It is an unambiguous description that makes clear what is to be implemented
It expects a defined set of inputs
It produces a defined set of outputs

A precondition refers to a requirement that an algorithm places on its inputs

The impression I get really is that with algorithms, it is all fixed 

- Basis Case
- Inductive Step

Leke take note that Python does not have like a false data type, instead what it has is None, and also in order to set a variable to true,
we need to set it to True

Linear Search is hardly used due to the fact that other search algorithms such as binary search and hash tables allow for faster searching comparison

With Jump Search, we are going to jump be jumping in intervals from the specified index. If we reach an index whose value is greater than the searched for value
then we will need to go back to the previous index and perform linear index from it to get the value

The difference between binary search and interpolation search is that binary search always goes to the middle to check while interpolation search may
go to different locations depending on the value of the item being searched

Linear search takes place in O(n) time while binary search takes place in O(Log n) time. Jump search takes place in O(sqrt n) time

Exponential Search involves finding the range where the element is present and doign binary search in the present range
