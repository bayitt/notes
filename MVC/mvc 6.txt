__call is a PHP magic method that is called whenever a nonexistent or nonpublic method is called from the class

The __call method takes the name of the method as the first parameter and the second parameter is the arguments

Actions will generally redirect to another action or they will output HTML

Action filters refer to code that is executed before or after an action

We can extend the functionality of the before action filter because if it returns false, then the method will not be called

The method_exists() function takes two parameters, the $this and the $method
The __call() method takes two parameters, the $name and $the args

The array_key_exists() function is used to check if a key exists in the array. It takes two parameters, the first parameter is the key while the second 
paramter is the array that it is checking

Breaking down the process of making use of the __call magic method for unavailable or non-public methods
We create the public function __call method and it takes two parameters, the $name and the $args
Then we create the method variable by concatenating the $name and 'Action'
Then we need to call the method_exists function and it takes two parameters, an array containing $this and the method name and the $args

Then we need to specify that the protected before method did not return false, after which the method can be called
Then we can call the protected after method
