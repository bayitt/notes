The public folder is the only folder publicly accessible to the web 

So Leke,we need to change the documentroot in the http.conf file top point to the public folder
in our app so that none of our sensitive information will be available outside

Making use of a front controller in which every url goes thru the same file, rather than having a url mapping to a file location, we can make use of a 
front controller. Instead of having urls mapping to scripts,we can have urls mapping to actions in our front controller

The request is in the query string and the query string is the part of the url after the first question mark, like the GET Variable


The MVC framewroek makes use of the front controller, so instead of a url mapping to a particular file, the query string is taken to the front controller and from that
an action is executed, so essentially they are not urls, they are actions. And umm with the MVC framework , we can prevent files containing important information to 
be hidden, like database passwords and such by reconfiguring our http.conf file

The $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] is used to access our query string

The router is what takes the query string and decides what to do with it

In php,it is advantageous to have specific classes in separate files, in that it makes it easier to find specific classes and it makes it easier to load 
classes automatically

The router is what determines the controller and action to run

Leke, arrays in php classes are usually protected in their array declaration. Also, when we are accessing arrays, we need to make use of the $this keyword

We create objects in php by making use of the new keyword

In order to access the functions from our classes we need to make use of the -> symbol

Leke take note that the return false statement should be located outside of the foreach loop and not inside
