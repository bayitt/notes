The dirname() function is used to obtain the parent directory of a directory

The __DIR__ returns the directory of a script file

Breaking down the process of using the namespaces 
We call the spl_autoload_register function
We need to obtain the root folder,

Leke, the explode() function is used to break a string into an array
It takes three parameters, the first parameter is the separator which specifies where to break the string
The second paramter is the string to split
The third optional paramter specifies the number of array elements to return

The strpos() function finds the first occurrence of a string inside another string
The first paramter specifies the string to search
The second parameter specifies the string to find
The last optional parameter specifies where to start inside the string to find

Leke, remember that after computing everything in the string function, we need to return the final url before making use of it in the dispatc=h function

Leke, note that anytime that you are working with regular expressions,anytime that you have a character group, just know that you can have it to be your subgroup

Abstract classes are classes in which we dont create objects directly instead, we create objects that extend these classes themselves

In PHP, the keyword to create a constructor is __construct

Leke, take note that in order to make use of an abstract class,we have to extend it 

Leke, you know that whenever you extend a class, it means that we can make use of the methods in our derived 
Leke, take note that the function to auto require a class is spl_autoload_register

Leke when making use of the spl_autoload_register() function, don't forget that in the concatenation it is .'.php' not .'php'
