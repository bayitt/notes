php files begin with a .php file extension. we can open <?php ?> blocks all on the page and execute code. php variables begin with dollar symbols.
concatenation in php is carried out with the . operator. single line comments are created with // or # while multi line comments are carried out with 
/**/ like in css. Variable names in php are case sensitive

Global Scope in php
A variable declared outside a function has a global scope and can only be accessed outside a function

Local Scope in php
A variable declared within a function has a local scope and can only be accessed within that function 

The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function. PHP also stores all global variables within an super global array called $GLOBALS[index]
. The array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to global variables directly.

Normally when a function is completed/executed all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable not to be deleted. We need it for a further
job. To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable.

echo() and print() are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen. echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can
be used in expressions. echo is marginally faster than print.

php supports the following data types
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- Resource

The var_dump() method in php returns the data type and the value of the variable

Common String methods in php
- strlen() returns the length of a string
- str_word_count() returns the number of words in a string
- strrev() reverses a string
- strpos() searches for a specific text within a string. If a match is found, the position of the first match is returned. If no match is found, it returns false.
- str_replace() replaces text within a string. It takes three parameters, the first parameter is the string to replace it with, the second parameter is the 
string to be found and the last parameter is the parent string
