Process of making use of the Twig Templating Engine

First we need to require the twig autoloader file
Then we need to call the register function on the autoloader file
Then we need to create the static function in the view
We need to speicfy that if $twig === null
The loader object should be created to locate the template
Then we need to create the environment object to store the configuration

Then we need to echo the render function on the twig object

Models are where an application's data
Models commonly store data in the database
A single model often corresponds to a single table in the database

To connect to a database in code, we need four things, a host,database name,username and password

PDO (PHP Data Objects is a code library for accessing databases)

Its advantages are that it is not specific to any database platform,Named parameters in SQL Statements,Exceptions are used in error handling

In order to create a connection to the database making use of PDOs,we need to create a PDO object, taking three parameters, host name and db name together and
then the database name and password.
This code should be enclosed in a try block and then in the catch block, we need to create an object of the exception and then call the getMessage() function on it

With SQL statements that do not return a result, we make use of the exec() function, but with SQL statements that return results we make use of the query() function

The exec() function returns the number of affected rows

We can make use of the prepare() function for complex SQL statements, with names SQL Parameters
