Templating Engines refer to tools that help us to separate the application code from the presentation code
Templates contain no php at all, Just HTML and simple tags to show the data

Variables in Templating Engines are automaticaclly escaped

Twig makes use of a loader to locate templates and an environment to store the configuration.The render method loads the template passed as  the first argument
and any other variables as the second argument.

Leke, remember that in Twig, after opening our loops, we need to close them with an endfor command

To make use of Twig, we first need to require the autoloader.php file
and the we need to call the autoloader function in the twig_autoloader file

Breaking down the Process of making use of the Twig Templating Engine
First we need to require the twig autoloader file
Then we need to call the Twig_autoloader register function
Then we need to create our function and in it we need to specify that if $twig===nullwe create our loader
which is what will search for our template making use of the Twig_Loader_FileSystem and then we need to create the Environment to store the configuration
Then we need to echo the twig render function taking the template and the optional variables as parameters.
