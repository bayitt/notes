Breaking down the process of creating the route regex
1) First we need to convert the forward slashes in our url into escape chars and forward slashes
2) Then we need to convert the {} pattern
3) Then we need to add the ^ and $ delimiters

Leke, remember that anytime you are making use of PHP regular expressions, the pattern needs to be enclosed in //

Leke, you need to take note and be careful where you put the return false statement in a loop because it terminates the loop

Leke, remember that in order to create route, we need our dispatch method

Leke, take note that with abstract classes, it is the classes themselves that we are extending, not the namespaces

From the constructor, we are taking in the route_params paramter and assigning it to the route_params array

__call is a PHP magic method, it is called anytime a nonexistent or private method is called on an object of a class 

The __call function takes two paramters, the name of the method being called and the arguments 

A controller can have many actions, these actions will generally output HTML and/or redirect to other actios

Action filters refer to functionality that enable us to perform some action before or after each method is called in a controller
