### Notes
---
Collection of notes I have amassed on my development journey thus far. This details stuff I have learned thus far, I am learning and will learn in the future. I like to think of it as a time machine that I can look back at to see myself at xyz point in my development career and also look at to see where I want to be. Here is to more languages, frameworks and tools!

Anyways. Away from all that mushy mushy stuff. To clone this repository, navigate into a directory of choice on your system and run the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/olamileke/notes
```

I hope it is helpful to xyz person out there.
