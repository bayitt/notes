Texture Mapping

This can be defined as a method of defining high frequency detail, surface texture or color information on a computer generated graphic or 3D model

UV Mapping

Stretching a 2D surface over a 3D surface

An Image is a 2D picture designed to be viewed by a human while a texture  specially prepared data used for various purposes in 3D graphics

When we add a texture to a material , we say we are assigning a texture to a map slot on a material


TextureLoader.load(url) returns an instance of texture that we can immediately use in our material and it loads it asynchronously

There are two ways that textures can be used

- either as colors designed to be seen by the human eye
- the texture represents something else, such as bumps on a human surface

When we deal with textures, we call pixels, texels

In 3D Rendering, we generally have to deal with two different color spaces, The first is sRGB and it is the color space used by colors that end up on the screen.
The second is linear space and it is the color space used inside the renderer

By default, textures are encoded in linear space, so we need to tell the renderer that this texture is encoded in sRGB space

There are also several other important map slots

Our OrbitControls property needs to take two parameters, the camera and the container

Light shining from only one direction is known as direct illumination while reflected light is called indirect illumination. Directional light + reflected light
is known as global illumination

Ambient light is a light that shines equally on all objects but without any direction

Generally, ambient lighting is used for artistic control rather than for strong lighting
