Transformation
Anything that changes the position, shape, rotation or anything else about the geometry of an object

Affine Transformation
Any transformation that preserves points, straught lines and planes is called affine transformation

Groups occupy a position in the scene graph but are invisible. They are special objects that we can use to organize our scene

When we move a group around, all of its children will move also. Likewise, if we rotate or scale it, all its children will be rotated or scaled too

Group also has add() and remove() methods

The flatShading parameter is used to give a material a faceted look

convertSRGBToLinear()

cylinderBufferGeometry

The first parameter represents the radius of the top of the cylinder
The second parameter represents the radius of the bottom of the cylinder
The third parameter represents the height of the cylinder
The last parameter is the radialSegments which specifies the level of detail of the outer curve of the cylinder

Angles in three js are specified in radians, not degrees

Three Js has helper methods for converting degrees and radians and vice versa Three.Math.degToRad() and Three.Math.radToDeg()

In ThreeJS, we can either set our positions individually using nose.position.x or we can set everything using shorthand like nose.position.set()

Rotations in ThreeJS go anti-clockwise

We can also clone meshes by making use of the Mesh.clone() method

When we are rotating geometries, we make use of the rotateX(), rotateY() or rotateZ() methods 

The Mesh.scale() method is also used to scale 

Leke ALWAYS remember to set the position of the camera
