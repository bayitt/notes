The @angular/cdk/drag-drop package from the Angular Component Development Kit provides you the functionality to easily create drag and drop
interfaces with full flexiblity

Then we need to import the DragDropModule in our root app module and add it to our list of imports

Important things to note
- We can add the cdkDrag directive to elements to make them draggable
- When outside of a cdkDropListElement, draggable elements can be moved freely around the page
- We can add cdkDropList elements to constrain where elements may be dropped

- Adding cdkDropList around a set of cdkDrag elements groups the draggables into a reorderable collection

The cdkDropList directive supports transferring dragged items between two connected drop zones. We can connect two or more cdkDropList instances together
by setting the cdkDropListConnectedTo property or by wrapping the elements in an element with the cdkDropListGroup attribute
