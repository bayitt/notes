We can implement the remember me functionality in several ways. We can make use of the session.cookie_lifetime and specify the time in seconds.
However, this is not advisable due to the fact that it is not optional

The random_bye function is cryptographically secure

HMAC() is similar to the password_hash() method which combines the hash with a secret keySECR

We can also create tokens from exisitng tokens

We are going to store the token in the cookie and the hash of the cookie in the database

Leke note that when inserting a date in sql, we need to make use of the date format

Breaking down the process of creating the token and storing the hashed token in the database
We need to create a class and in the constructor we need to specify that if a token value is not provided a token should be generated making use of the
bin2hex() and random_bytes methods
Then we need to create a getValue() method that returns the token that we have generated
Then we need to create a getHash() method that return the hashed value of the token making use of the hash_hmac() function takes three parameters
The first parameter being the encryption algorithm that will be made use of , in this case sha256, then the second parameter is the token, while the
third parameter is the encryption key which we are recommended to store in an outside file, probably config.php

When making use of dates in mysql or mariadb we need to send them in the format date("Y-m-d h:i:s")

Leke take note of the openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()

Cookies are small strings of text that a website can store in a web browser. Cookies are specific to a website or a web domain
Don't store sensitive stuff like email addresses or passwords in a cookie

To set a cookie in PHP, we make use of the set_cookie() function and to read the cookie we make use of the $_COOKIE array

The first parameter in the setcookie() method is the name of the cookie while the second paramter is the value of the cookie

The third argument of setcookie() is the time that we want the cookie to expire. The value is in unix timestamp

In order to delete a cookie, we need to set the expiry to a time in the past

Cookies also have a path attribute

Cookies are available relative to the directories where they are set

The fourth argument of the setcookie() function is the path, with this argument we can specify whatever directories we want to set our cookies in

One thing to take note of is that we have to be careful not to send any other content before the setcookie()function is called
