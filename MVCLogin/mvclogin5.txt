Revision

Leke take note that the errorHandler() method needs to take the level,message,file and line parameters while the thrown exception needs to take message,0, level,file
and line. Also, take note of the error_reporting() method

Leke REMEMBER that the error.php file goes in the CORE folder. It is NOT  a Controller. Leke, remember the getMessage() method called on the exception

Leke take note that twig syntax takes beginning and closing %% for everything except variables which take double {{}}

Leke,take note that $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] returns the last webpage that was accessed

In situations in which we need to check if the user is logged in for every method in the controller we can create a before action filter and it
works for us automatically

Leke with classes in which all actions need authentication we can create an authenticated class and get the class to extend it 

We can add the data about the user as a global variable making use of the addGlobal() method
