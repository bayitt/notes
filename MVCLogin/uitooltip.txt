Leke remember that in HTML, in order to set a tooltip, we need to make use of the title attribute

Leke take note that you need to include the css files for the jquery ui

The content property of the jquery ui tooltip is used to override the default text set in the tooltip

We can also make the tooltip property remain as we move across the html element. Just set the track property to true

We can make use of the effect property to specify what effect we want whenever the element is hovered upon

In order for the effect to be displayed , we need to make use of the show property and refer it to an object contanining the effect and the duration

Some of the applicable effects include pulsate, fadeIn, bounce, explode

Leke take note that the show and hide properties are entire objects of their own and they refer to objects too
