Things to Note
In order to make the page not reload, do not specify the action attribute in the form and also remember to set the button type to button

Note that we can set the value of a HTML input to nothing by calling the val() method to ""

The prop() method sets or returns properties and values of the selected elements
When this method is used to return the property values, it returns the value of the FIRST matched element and viceversa for when it is used to set values

JQUERY has a special formdata class of which objects can be created to represent formdata

contentType is used to specify the content type of the data sent to the server
processData: We can set this option to false, if we want whatever we send to the server to go in as whatever we want it to go as rather than as string
Then Leke, note that whenever we have just one data item to go the server , we do not need to create an object to send it

Also, whenever we need to get back the response of a php script we get it back using php_script_response

The str.replace() method is used to replace strings

Leke take note that we call the replace method on the string itself

Leke, it is possible to wrap an ajax() method in a function and return it

Leke, take note that is not possible to redirect or render a view from with JQuery

Leke, if you want to check for the existence of a string in Javascript, just say if(the variable) rather than checking if it is empty

Leke take note that if once you return something from a function, the function terminates

The each() method in JQUERY takes a closure as its parameter and it refers to all the child element through the $(this) operatore
