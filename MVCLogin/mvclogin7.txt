Breaking down the process of creating remembered me functionality
1) We need to create a method to call if the session's user_id variable is not present
2) Then we need to specify that if the cookie variable is present that a call needs to be made to the findByToken() method of the rememberedLogin Model.
3) Then we need to specify that if the appropriate object is returned that a call then needs to be madde to the findByUserId() method of the User Model via the 
rememberedLogin Model, Then we need to call the static loggedIn() method, passing the object as the required parameter


Breaking down the process of logging out after making use of a cookie to stay logged in

a remembered login object is created and this object calls the delete() method
