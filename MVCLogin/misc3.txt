Leke take note of the JQUERY children() method or the find() method

Then also, with PDOS, when trying to execute a LIKE statement , enclose the % in braces()

Breaking down the process of remembering URLS

We need to create a noAccess() method in our Auth class in which is called whenever the user tries to access a restricted page and is not logged in

In this noAccess() method, we rememeber the url that the user tried to access and we store it in the session.
Then we need to create another method called rememberURL in which if the session url is present we return it, else it returns  ''

Then after logging in, we need need to redirect to the page that we stored in the session by calling the rememberURL() method from the Auth class

The setInterval() method in Javascript takes two parameters, a closure and time and every time that frame occurs, the function is executed

We can also name the interval and stop it making use of the clearInterval() method

Another option for the animate() method is obj, time and callback, instead of obj,obj

Things to take note of
All the images in the slider must be of the same height and width
The container div and the ul and the li must be of the same height too, but the ul must be larger 

Note: Tip, try to keep all the similar code together, confgiguration code should go in one place and another seoarate

It's also good to cache the DOM
Caching the DOM involves selecting the various HTML elements just once.

Then, in order for the animation to work, we need to find a way to determine what slide the slider is currently on.
We do this by declaring a current slide variable at the top and incrementing the variable in a callback after the animate() method has  been executed.

Then we can check if we are on the last slide, and if we are we set the currentslide variable back to 1 and we set the css property of the ul
or containing slider back to 0

The on() method is used to listen for an event

We need to set the animate() method to a variable interval that we defined

Then we also need to do this inside a function startSlider()

Then we need to define a method stopSlider() in which we clear the interval making use of the clearInterval() method

Leke, whenever you are working on the sliders, never forget to set the padding and margin of the unordered lists to 0
