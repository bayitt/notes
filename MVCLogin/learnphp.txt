Things to take note when uploading images with PHP

The Form method must be POST
The Form must have an attribute enctype="multipart/form-data"

We first need to check if the image in the files array is not empty
If it is not empty, then we can get to work creating the image details
$Imagename has a suffix of name in the files array
$imagetemp has a suffix of tmp_name
$imagesize has a suffix of size
For the image extension we need the pathinfo() function which takes $imagename and PATHINF0_EXTENSII
Then we need to construct the image path

What actually moves the images to the folder is the move_uploaded_file() method which takes the image's temporary name and its $Imagepath variable

Leke take note that when you include an access specifier in a variable declaration that that means that the varible or array can only be accessed from an object

The JQuery $.ajax() method is used to perform an asynchronous HTTP Request. The $.ajax() method takes two parameters, the first is a url specifying where we want the
ajax request to go to, while the second is a Javascript object containing the configurations

The various options which can be accepted in the options parameter include
accepts
complete-A method to specify a function that is executed after the request is completed
data-The data to send to the server when performing the request
error-a function to be called if the callback fails
success- a function to be called if the request is successful
type-The type of request to be made, either GET or POST
url- a string containing the URL to which the request is made to the server

Leke take note that in order for the form not to close when making use of JQUery, you must not set the action and the button type must be set

Leke take note that you cannot return anything from a function that is asychronous
