It's good practice to save small amounts of data to the session rather than large amounts

Leke, take note of the addGlobal() method of the twig loader with which we can add traditional PHP superglobals, it takes two methods,
what we want the global array to be named and which super global we are adding

When session_start() is called, a session cookie is stored in the browser, this session cookie does not have an expiry time and as such is only deleted when
the browser is closed

session_destroy() is not enough to get rid of a session, to completely destroy the session, we need to unset all the session variables and unset the session cookie

The code that we need to type to completely destroy a session

$_SESSION=array();

if(ini_get("session.use_cookies")) 
{
	$params=session_get_cookie_params();
	setcookie(session_name(), '', time() - 42000,
		 $params['path'],$params['domain'],$params['secure'],$params['httponly']);
}

session_destroy();

A session fixation attavk is when a hacker exploits vulnerabilities in a website to gain access to user accounts

We can also make use of the exit method to echo out code and leave a page

Leke, take note that the REQUEST_URI parameter of the $_SERVER superglobal returns the last page that was accessed
