Introduction to CSS Flexbox
Flexbox is a CSS Display type designed to help us craft CSS Layouts much easier

Flexbox is not fully supported in all browsers, it has issues especially in IE.In order toget around this, we need to provide fall back
options. This is where modernizr comes in

What modernizr does is detect which browser your webpage is being viewed n

The default behaviour of flex items is to stack fromleft toright

in order to make the flex items fill up the entirety of the parent container, we need to set their flex-growth property to 1 value
Remember that bthe flex-growth property is set on the flex items not the flex container

What flex-grow does is that it splits the items according to the values that we specified
Flex grow is splitting the extra space

flex-shrink is the opposite such that as we shrink the element, the one with the largest value for the flex-shrink is shrunk the most

we use flex-wrap when we have flex items that like have a minimum width that they cannot go below, so when it reaches the minimum width, it wrapsand
goes to the next line

flex-wrap is applied to the flex container

The difference between wrap and wrap-reverse is that with wrap the wrapped flex item goes below while with wrap, the wrapped flex item goes above

Another option for the flex-wrap property is nowrap which is the default behaviour

flex-basis is similar to the min-width property in that it specifies a base point for the width

The difference between min-width and flex-basis is that min-width, when the browser reaches the width it doesnt care, it leaves it
while flex-basis makes it responsive

flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis can be combined into a single flex property. The first value represents the flex-grow, the second value represents the
flex-shrink while the last value represents the flex-basis

Leke take note that whenever you specify max-width, the width that you specify is the percentage of that max-width

Leke take note that any constants that you declare has to be inside the class
