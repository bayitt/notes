The JQuery animate() method is used to create custom animations

It takes three paramters, a required params object which contains the properties which are to be animated, speed and a callback or closure method to be
executed.The speed paramter can also take values such as slow, fast or milliseconds

One thing to take note is that when making use of the animate() method all properties must be camelCased

Leke, take note that with the Flash, getMessages() class, we always need to include the if statement for the flash notifications array. This is because it is not all
the time that the notifs will be available

Leke, take note that it is always best to just go straight to signup/index or login/index straight to prevent confusion

Leke, take note that in order to access the errors array, it needs to be have a public access specifier

With logging in the findUserByEmail method is extremely important

Leke, try as much as possible to avoid code duplication and unnecessary spaghetti code. If you can modify a existing method to do what you want to do,
do so.
