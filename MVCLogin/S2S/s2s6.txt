The problem was that I needed to find a way to position the button at the extreme right of the input all the time. So I solved it by giving the button's margin

Essentially the whole idea behind fetching more posts is that what we need really is the html constrcuted in the same format as we have it in the home page.

the posts that we fetched and concatenate the text in that format

The whole idea behind the loader animation is that because we dont specify the color, it defaults to the color of the parent element, and then we specify
the border to be transparent, then we override it by specifying the border top to be white so that it stands out

searched string, we just add the global identifier g for that
