Leke take note that the offset().top returns the beginning of a HTML element

Essentially, what is happening here is that I am making use of the pseudo classes
Essentially, it is the height that determines how thick it is

The getMonth() method which is called on an object of date returns the current month. It returns a number from 0-11 which represents an array
from January to December

In order to get the current year, we call getFullYear() on the object of date

Breaking down the process of obtaining the calendar
1) We need to create a date object
2) Then we need to call getMonth() on the date object to obtain a number from 0-11 representing January to December
3) Then we need to call getFullYear() on the date object to obtain the current year
4) Then we need to construct a string to pass as the constructor to another date object and we call the toDateString() method on it. This returns the date in
string format like Mon Sep 2 2014
5) Then we need to call substring on the returned string to obtain the first day of the current month
6) Then we need to get the index of the first day of the current month
7) We do this by calling indexOf 
8) Then we need to get how many days are in the current month by passing the current year, month +1  and 0 as constructors and calling rhe getDate() method on it

The reason why the animation was not working when I tried it wuth the left background position was because it was already displaying the full width of
the image, there was nothing to display anymore. But when I tried it with the top background property it worked because there was still something to display
So essentially what I need to play around with is the background-position property

The whole idea behind css is that you style the elements with the general styling first before going on to style the individual elements
We can set the border of the table, td and th but thos creates multiple borders so we can get rid of this by setting the border-collapse property to collapse
to collapse it all into a signle border

Apparently, I cannot set padding on the thead element, but I can create padding on the th and td

Leke, note that if I want to put an empty div,all I need to do is to specify the width and the height
