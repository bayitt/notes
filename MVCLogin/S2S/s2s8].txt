How did I solve the problem of form validation
1) I created a validation() method that is executed when the form is submitted
2) What the validation method does is that it checks all the text elements on the page to make sure that they are not empty
3) If any one is empty it adds a message that the field cannot be empty
4) Then I also created two methods to check the phonenumber field specifically, the checkphoneno() and checkphoneval() methods
5) The checkphoneno() method checks the length of the value, and returns false if it nots equal to 11
6) If its not equal to 11, it adds the error message after the phone field'
7) Also, the checkphoneval() method checks if what is in the phone field is a number, if it is, it returns true, else it adds an error message
