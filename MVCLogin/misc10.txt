justify-content with a property of center is going to put all the content in the center
A property of flex-end will position it at the end of the flex container, flex-start is the default behaviour which positions the text at the beginning
Other properties are space-around  which gives space around the flex items while space-between gives it space between it

Essentially there are two different ways of creating our menu bar,we apply the display property of flex on our ul, Then we set our justify-content 
property to flex-start, Then we set our flex grow. Or we can set our justfiy-content to space-around

The default flow of a flex container is from left to right but we can override it by setting its flex-flow property to column

Whenever we set the flex-flow to go in a column, the flex basis instead if controlling the min-width, controls the minimum height'

Whenever we use flexbox, we have a main axis and cross axis. When we change the flex flow to column, all we are doing is changing the direction of the axis
The flex items always follow the direction of the main axis. The justify-content property is only ever applied to the main axis

If we want the justify-content property to be displayed when the flex flow is column, we ALWAYS need to specify the height of the flex-container

With justify-content, when we make use of row reverse and flex-start, the beginning becomes the end

Just like justify-content affects the main axis only, align-items is going to affect the cross-axis

I'm guessing that align-items cannot take properties of space-around and space-between

Leke ALWAYS remember that when flex-flow is set to column or column reverse that the flex-basis sets the height

ALWAYS take note of the flex-flow that we are making use of

border-sizing:border-box is very useful in that it incorporates any margin or padding that we add inside of the overall width of the element

Leke take note that just like flex-wrap, justify-content is applied to the flex-container

The default value for the order property of each flex element is 0

With the order property, the lower values come first

The order property also works for negative values

The whole idea behind creating navogation bars is that we dont specify the actual height,rather we use padding to get the height that we desire

Also, in our parent elements , it is always best to set the initial padding and margin to 0

We need to set the links display type to be block
