When an animation is created in the @keyframe rule, we need to bind it to a selector, else the animation will have no effect

We bind the animation to a selector by specifying atleast two properties, the name and the duration of the selector

We can specify when the animation will happen in percentage or we can make use of from and to which means 0% and 100%

Animations also have several sub properties which are animation-name,animation-duration, animation-timing-function,animation-delay, 
animation-iteration count, animation-direction, animation-play state
