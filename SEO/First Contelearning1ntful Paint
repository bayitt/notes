First Contentful Paint
This is when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first bit of feedback to the user that the page is actually 
loading.

First Input Delay
FID measures the time from when a user interacts with a page (i.e when they click a link, tap on a button or use custom, Javascript powered control)
to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction. The lower the better.
To provide a good, user experience, sites should be able to provide a good FID of 100 milliseconds or less.
