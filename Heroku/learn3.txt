Breaking down the process of deploying an Angular app to Heroku

- We first need to make sure that we are logged in to heroku via the CLI. This is done by installing the CLI and running heroku login
- We first need to head over to our to our heroku dashboard and create an application
- Specify its name and create
- Then we need to connect it to our github account and a particular repository
- Then we need to connect it to our master branch and set up automatic deployment
- Then we need to head back to our angular app and add the angular cli and compiler to our dependencies. Add typescript to
- Then we need to add the "heroku-postbuild" command to our npm scripts and specify ng build --prod like we would do normally
- Then we need to add the "engines" key to our package.json and specify our node and npm versions so that heroku knows what versions to know to use to build
our app
- Then we need to install express and path
- Then we need to add server.js to our app root. In it we specify the dist folder as a place where our app can access files by making use of the express.static()
middleware
- Then we need to specify a route handler for the / route in which we send the index file generated from the build
- Then we need to push our changes
- My hypothesis for why this works the way it does is that anytime heroku receives a new change, it triggers a new build using the command specified in
heroku-postbuild
