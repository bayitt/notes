All standard DOM events have a target property, a reference to the elemnt that raised the event

Leke remember that the $event object contains a whole payload of information about the DOM event, just like $event.target returns the html element that had the
event, $event.key returns the key on the keyboard that was clicked

REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural style of communication between applications which relies on a stateless protocol (usually http)
for interaction

With REST, we use the HTTP verbs as actions , and the endpoints are the resources acted upon

get: retrieve resources
post:create resources
put:update resources
delete:delete resources

Resources are the targets of the actions 

The urls for your api should not contain verbs

Leke, when migrating you can add the --step option to run the migrations individually, this is done when you have more than 1 migration obviously

Leke take note that in order to create a faker object the full namespace is \Faker\Factory::create()

Leke take note that you can even seed the database individually, just add a --class extension to your db:seed command and specify the seeder to run

HTTP Status Codes

200- The standard success code and default option
201- Object created, mostly used for posting or creating new daat
204- When an action was executed successfully but there is no content to return
400- Bad requests. The standard option for requets that fail to  pass validation
401- Unauthorized, the user needs to be authenticated
403- The user is authenticated but does not have the permission to perform such an action
404- This will be automatically returned by Laravel when the requested for resource is noy found
500- Internsal server error

And Leke remember that resources are the targets of the http actions
