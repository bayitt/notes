I think essentially, the important thing about a resource class is its toArray() method

Remember how Resources represent a single model object transformed into json, and collections represent a collection of model objects which are transformed
into json, essentially for when we are transforming multiple rows from our table. 

Resources are created making use of the php artisan make:resource ResourceNem command, while collections can be created in two ways either by
php artisan make:resource User --collection or with php artisan make:collection User

An alternative way to create collections is by calling the static collection method on a resource
