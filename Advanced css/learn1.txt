CSS Border Images
With the CSS border-image, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element.

The property has three parts
- The image to be used as the border
- Where to slice the image
- Define whether the middle sections should be repeated or stretched

The border image property takes the image and slices it into nine sections, like a tic tac toe board. It then places the corners at the corners,
and the middle sections are repeated or stretched as you specify.

Take note that in order for us to use border-image we must have the border set.

space means that the image should be repeated, while stretch means that the image should be stretched

CSS allows us to add multiple background images to an element, through the background-image property. The different background images are separated by commas, 
and the images are stacked on top of each other, where the first image is closest to the user. Just like how the background images are separated by commas,
all the other background properties are also separated by commas

The cass background-origin property specifies where the background image is positioned. The property takes three different values:
border-box
padding-box
content-box

padding-box is the default and it makes sure that the image starts from inside the element, with border-box, it ensures that the image starts
from the border, while with content-box, the image starts from the content

background-clip property specifies the painting area of the background
border-box - the background is painted to the outside edge of the border
padding-box - background is painted to the 

background clip and background origin are actually really simiar. The difference is that background-origin is used for background images while background-clip
is used for mere backgrounds. With background-origin, padding-box is the default while for background-clip border-box is the default
