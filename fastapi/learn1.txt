FastAPI is a modern, fast (high performance) web framework for building APIs with Python3.6 based on standard
Python type hints.

The key features are:
- fast
- fast to code
- fewer bugs
- intuitive
- easy
- short
- standards based

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants, 
- Starlette for the web parts
- Pydantic for the data parts

We run our FastAPI applications with uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the docs for your application via the /docs and the /redoc routes

Python has support for optional type hints. These type hints are a special syntax that allow declaring the type of a variable
The standard python types are 
- int
- float
- bool
- bytes
- str

To declare those types and the internal types, we can make use of the standard Python module typing
Define a list of strings in Python with List[str]

We would declare tuples and sets in similar ways. By importing Tuple and Set from typing

Type parameters refer to the parameters which are passed to a type. 

In order to declare a typed dictionary, we would do so like Dict[str, float]

Finally, we can make use of Optional to declare that a variable has a tpype, but that it is optional, meaning that it may not
exist

Those types that take type parameters are called Generic types, or Generics. These are List, Tuple, Set, Dict, Optional and others
