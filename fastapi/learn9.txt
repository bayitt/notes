When using any of Path(), Query(), Header(), Cookie(), Body(), Form(), File() you can also declare a data example or a group of examples that will be added to OpenAPI

Additional data types that we can make use of with FastAPI. These include:
- uuid
- datetime.datetime
- datetime.date
- datetime.time
- datetime.timedelta
- frozenset
- Decimal

You can also define Cookie parameters in the same way that you define Query and Path parameters
You can also define Header parameters in the same way that you define Query and Path parameters. Header also has a special behavior. Since most headers make use of hyphens that
separate them but Python does not allow variable names like that. So what Header does is that it converts snake_case header variables to title, hyphen case.
If we want to disable this behavior, we can pass convert_underscores to False to the Header() function
