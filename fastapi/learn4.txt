Breaking down what I need to do to implement this
- I query the db for a list of all the subscriptions in the app that are stocks
- I query the API for the current, updated prices of the stocks
- I store the returned data from the API
- I create threads based on all the telegram users I have in the app and compose their information and return it to them

Important things to know about the Python Requests library
- we can access the status code of the response by accessing the status_code property on the response
- we can access the raw response in bytes by accessing the content property on the response
- we can access the text response by accessing the text property on the response
- we can access the response as a python dictionary by accessing the json() method on the response
- we can pass in query params by passing in a params keyword argument to requests.get
- we can also pass in a headers keyword argument to requests.get
