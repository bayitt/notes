If you have a path operation taht receives a path parameter, but you want the possible valid path parameter
values to be predefined, we can make use of a standard Python Enum. 

To do this, we are going to create a class that is going to inherit from both str and Enum

With FastAPI, when you declare other function parameters that are not path of the path parameters,
they are automatically interpreted as query parameters

To declare a request body, you need to make use of Pydantic models with all their power and benefits

note the following Python methods
- dict() - generates a new dictionary
- ** - this is like spread in javascript
- update() - pass in a key value pair

For validating data, we are going to make use of the Query module from FastAPI
