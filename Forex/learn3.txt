There are spreads between all the major currencies that are traded

The Major world currencies

Essentially, the whole idea of spreads is that whatever price that you buy a currency at, if there is a difference between your buying price and the seling price,
the broker will make up the difference, but if the trade does not go your way then the broker will deduct the spread from your account
