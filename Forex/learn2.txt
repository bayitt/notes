There are six major currencies in the world traded against the dollar. When three go up, the other three have to go down so as to keep the world econonmy.

The modern Forex market was established around 1973 but the Bretton Woods Accord of 1944, which was established to stabilize the global economy after World War II
is generally accepted as the origins of the foreign exxhange market. It created the concept of trading currencies against each other and the International 
Monetary Fund

Currencies from around the world were fixed to the US dollar which was fixed to gold prices in the hope of bringing stability to the global forex market.

All currencies were allowed to flunctuate around that value but only within a narrow trading range. Central Banks agreed to intervene in case their currency
moved or threatened to move outside that range. If it did move, the country had the right to declare an imbalance and as a result of this imbalance, result
in a revaluation or devaluation of the country's currency	

In 1971, the accord failed. In 1971 and 1972, two more attempts were made to establish free floating currencies against the dollar, the Smithsonian Agreement and
the European Joint Float

Float a Currency - To create a policy by which by which a strong economic currency, such as the US dollar which in turn is anchored to the price of gold as 
a benchmark (also known as the gold standard) to bring stability to a volatile global economic situation

All other weaker currencies are then fixed against the USD and allowed to flunctuate or float no more than 1 percent on either side of the fixed rate

The Smithsonian agreement and the European Joint Float Agreement were similar to the Bretton Woods Agreement except that the currencies had greater latitude
to flunctuate

After the failure of all three agreements, countries were agreed to freely float eventually being mandated to do so by the IMF in 1978, but this still 
resulted in major economic devalutation 

European currencies were amongst those affected by the strength of the US dollar and the pound. As a result, in 1978, the European Monetary System was created
to counter the dependence on the dollar but by 1978, it was clear the European Monetary System had failed.

The euro was created in 1999

Forex essentially is a market where people exchange the currency of one country for another in order to do business internationally

Forex is also called the cash market or spot interbank market
