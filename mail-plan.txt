What exactly am I trying to build ?

A dedicated service that handles any and everything related to emails in my different side projects. The respective side projects/applications need to be able to connect to this service
anytime they want to send emails to users. My thinking is that each project gets an api key that authenticates the email requests. Also, each mail action needs to have a unique identifier.

Database Structure
Application
- uuid (string) (pk)
- name (string)
- api_key (string) (nullable)
- layout (string) (nullable)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime)

Credentials
- uuid (string) (pk)
- application_uuid (string) (nullable)
- type (int)
- values (JSON)
- created_at (datetime)
- nullable (datetime)

Email
- uuid (string) (pk)
- application_uuid (string) (fk)
- name (string)
- template (string)
- variables (array) (nullable)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime)
