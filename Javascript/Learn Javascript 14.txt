AJAX is a way that enables us to grad data from the intenet thru javascript

Sending a GET Request
we create the HTTP Object
Then we need to specify the url
And finally we need to specify the method

Then we need to call the open() method on the XMHttpRequest object, Then we need to create an eventhandler for the readystatechange event.
We can call the JSON.parse() method on the http.responseText to convert it to JSON format

In order to make POST requests, we need to change some things, like we need to change the method to POST, then we need to set the  setRequestHeaders() function, 
and the purpose is to let the server knwo the kind of information that we are gerring

201 is the response gotten from a POST Request, since 201 means everything is fine and a new resource was just deposited
Leke the setRequestHeader() method has to be called after the open method has been called and it takes two parameters, 'Content-Type' and
'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
