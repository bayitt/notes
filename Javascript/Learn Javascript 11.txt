Document Object Model

Essentially, the window consists of the entire tab. The Window object stores the Location object. The browser takes renders the HTML to the DOM

We can access the Width of the window by making use of the window.innerWidth method. The DOM is contained in the window object.
We dont even need the window part to access the merhod because it is the global scope,
Then the outerWidth method is used to access the total screen width

We also have innerHeight and outerHeight

Another useful property is localStorage which will save certain values in your application provided your application is running. To store values, we call the
setItem() method of localStorage and it takes two parameters, the key and the value. To access values stored in the local storage,we call the getItem()
method of localStorage() and pass the kay to it

sessionStorage() can also be used for the same purposesp but the difference is that after the tab is closed, localStorage still exists while if the tab is closed
the sessionStorage() data is deleted.

The window object also has a location property, It also has a document property that returns the DOM.
The window.open() function tries to open the website url passed to the function

The different properties of the location object are pathname, to access the relative path of the window object
We also have the reload() method which causes the webpage to reload, then we have the location.replace() in which we pass a string to access

We can access the page url with the document.url property
We can also use the document.title property to access the title of the page
We can make use of the document.body property to access the body of the HTML

We can make use of the document.body.children property to access an array of all the HTML tags present on the page

Each HTML element in the body is transformed into its individual object with its properties

Traversing the DOM
Instead of using the array methods to access the DOM elements, we can traverse the DOM, we can make use of the firstChild property and this will return 
the whitespace, so to access the first HTML element we need to make use of the firstElementChild property.
The nextElementSibling is used to access the next HTML element when traversing the DOM
Then the parentElement is used to access the parent Element
