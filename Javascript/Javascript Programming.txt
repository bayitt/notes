Leke, in order to position HTML Elements in the center of the page, we need to give it a margin property of auto and a specify the width

Leke, the background-image property can be set in css with background-image:url("Leke.jpg")
Also, background-repeat can also be set in CSS with background-repeat:no-repeat, or repeat-x to tile it horizontally or repeat-y to tile it vertically.


background-image:url("My name is Leke.jpg")
background-repeat:none;
Leke, note that when working with input-group-addon, you can place it at the beginning, by just shifting the div or span tag containing the i tag.
You can also make use of any symbol in your addon, by giving it an id, and then in your input, you include ariadescribedby=id

Leke, remember that the data has to be physically sent to the page, either by Javascript thru AJax or by php thru the action parameter.
All HTML Elements are Element Nodes
All HTML Attributes are attribute nodes

Leke you need to realize that even if you do not get any returned text, the http object just returns the entire DOM as the response text
