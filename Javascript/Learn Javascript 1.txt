Javascript executes or runs on your browser instead of running on the server.
But Javascript can also run on the server with nodejs

ES stands for EMASscript, It is like the overarching language of Javascript, so Javascript is like a dialect of ECMAScript.

To embed Javascript in our webpage, we need to use the script tags.Just like the <?php?> for php.

It is best practice to put your script tag at the end of the body tag

Leke, the noscript tag is used to display messages only if Javascript is not enabled in the web browser

It is common and good pracice to separate your html and your javascript and to import it, just like you do in python. For this, the script tag needs to taka
a src attribute which is the path to the javascript file

The defer attribute of the src tag is used to make all the other javascript files execute before executing the one with the defer attribute

Variables are created in Javascript by using the var keyword and then the variable name

Javascript does not recognize any difference between integers and float values. They are both of type "number"in Javascript.
The typeof is used to check data-type of a variable in Javascript, just like var_dump() and type() in PHP and Python respectively

Basic data types in Javascript include number, string, boolean, object

We can set a variable to be undefined, but it is not advisable to do this

Incase we want to set a variable to empty, instead of setting it to undefined, set it to null

Remember that the === operator is used to check if the data types of two variables are equal

Finally we have the NaN data type, and it stands for Not a Number. Calling typeof on this returns number, so basically,

Null is of type object

It is possible to have fields/variables in objects and methods/functions in objects
