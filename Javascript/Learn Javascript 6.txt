Javascript Objects

With objects,we always have key value pairs like python dictionaries

The this keyword is just like the self keyword in Python OOP

We can create objects alternatively using the object constructor

We can create another object b;y means of the new() keyword. Using the new keyword returns an empty object

Prototypes are like inheritance in Javascript

Objects have prototypes and then we can create new objects based on the prototypes.

The argument of the object.create() function specifies which protoype we want to create for the object being created

In summary, Javascipt objects can be created in three different ways
1) Using the Javascript Object Notation
2) Using the new keyword
3) Using prototypes to inherit other objects

All Javascript objects have a default protoype which is object.prototype
There is an unsafe method to access an objects's prototype which is __proto__

The object prototype contains both the hidden functions and the fields, properties of the object

The static method getPrototypeOf()can be used inplace of __proto__

We can also make use of Constructor Functions to create Objects

Leke to access the prototype of the original function, use .prototype

'this'  represents the global scope or the window object

When  using constrcutorfunctions and you specify the same name for the variable/function, The one in the function overrdies the one in the prototype

Leke, the flow of execution is that it checks the constructor function first before checking the prototype

The instanceof keyword is used to check if an object is an instance of a constructor function.

To create an object that does not inherit from the default object prototype we use the object.create() method with a parameter of null
