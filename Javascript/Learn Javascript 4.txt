Primitive types are like integers, strings
Reference types are like arrays, objects

The difference between primitive types and reference types is that with primitive types when you create a copy of the variable, the entire value is copied
so that ifyou change the original value, it does not affect the value of the copied variable but with  reference variables if you copy the variable, it is not
the entire variable that is copied but only a pointer to the variable, so of you change the original variable value, it will become the value of the copied variable
