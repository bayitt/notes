this does not always refer to the window object. To make sure that the window object is returned, call the bind() method on the function.
bind() cn take arguments, the first argument is always what you want this to refer to, while the other arguments refer to the remaining arguments in the original function.

Alternatively to bind(), we can mske use of the call() method, but the call() method does not need the additional () at the end

With bind(), you can bind the this value and use it later, while with call() you use the this instantly

We also have apply() and the difference between it and call is that it taes the additional parameters as an array

Normally we can define properties in the object, but we can make use of the defineProperty() method to do this. The first parameter is the name of the object, the 
second parampeter is the name of the property/function, while the third parameter is a nested object.
The advantage of creating properties with defineProperty() is that they are read-only and cannot be changed. To make them editable, we need to use set another
key in it, and set it to writable:true; There is also the enumerable value

The get() function of th defineProperty() method is called whenever we try to acess the name variable

With getters and setters, the get() function is called anytime we try to print the variable
The set() function is called anytime we assign a value to a variable

In order to delete items from our objects we use the delete keyword

With the in keyword we can check if a field exists in an object

The essential built in Object properties are delete, in , loop thru the items in the object
