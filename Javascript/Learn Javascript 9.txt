Built in Objects
Timers and Intervals

The setTimeout() function takes two parameters, the name of the function to be executed and the amount of milliseconds that it should wait before 
executing the function. Important method to trigger events

The setInterval() function also takes a function as a paramter and a time in milliseconds, It is used to execute code for the particular time you specify.

To stop the setInterval() function, we will make use of the clearInterval() function

The parseInt() method is used to convert variable to Integer. It can also be used to transfrom hexadecimal values to integer, we just need to add a second
parameter to the parseInt() method, this parameter will be 16 since we are dealing with a hexadecimal system and the default is the decimal system

The toString() function is used to convert a parameter into string.

We can also call the length function on strings. The charAt()function can be used in place of the array indexing method
The concat() method can also be called on strings
The toUppercase() is used to convert strings to uppercase much like the strtoupper() function and the upper()function in PHP
The toLowerCase() function is used to convert strings to lowercase
the split() method also exists and it returns an array
The trim() function is used to remove excess spaces in a string

The Math object gives us access to a built in object containing math values
The abs() method
The round() method
The ceil() method
The max() method returns the largest of a list of numbers
The min() method returns the smalles number in a list of numbers
The random() method returns a random number between 0 and 1
Seeing as the random method returns a decimal, to convert it to like a number between 0 and 100, we need to multiply it by 100 and then pass it to the parseInt()
method to convert it to an integer. Instead of using this long method, we can just make use of the floor() method of the Math object which returns an integer
