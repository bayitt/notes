Javascript Event

On the window object,we have the load event and we can add the onload handler to this event

We also have the onclick event handler

Rather than makin use of event handlers, we can make use of event listeners to add multiple functions to an event
Just like we have the addEventListener(), we can also have the removeEventListener()

Leke remember that closures are assigned to the event handlers

Javascript Behaviours

Leke remember that it is addEventListener(), or removeEventListener()

Javascript passes the event object automatically to your listeners
Events by default in Javascript propagate

If we have nested elements and we assign listeners to both of them, If we want to stop propagation, we can just make use of the stopPropagation() method
of the event object

We can make use of event.bubbles to check if the event has the goal of bubbling,  that is propagating all the listeners of the parent elements;

event.target is used to access the target of the listener, that is the HTML element that it is going to act upon

Leke remember that the event.target returns an object
We can also access the position of the click by calling the clientX method on the event object

In order to change the propagation order, like to execute the outer method instead of the inner method we can add a true parameter to the outerEventListene
