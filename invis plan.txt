What exactly am I trying to build ?

A simple status page through which I can be kept apprised of the status of all my different applications. I want to be able to come to it, and it shows me all the different applications
and their different child services along with their status. It's going to be written in Vue JS along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Here are all the different applications that need to be monitored
Dome
- Dome (usedo.me)
- Gello (app.usedo.me)
- Zilch (api.usedo.me) (done)
- duran (backups.usedo.me) (done)

Maui
- Maui (mauii.xyz) 
- maui-api - (api.mauii.xyz) (done)
- mauibot - (bot.mauii.xyz)

Yeet
- Yeet (theyeetapp.com) (done)
- Yeetbot (bot.theyeetapp.com)

Bayitt
- Pluto (blog.olamileke.dev)
- Noir (api.olamileke.dev) (done)
- Crest (to.olamileke.dev) (done)
- Cyclone (cyclone.olamileke.dev) (done)
- Notify (notify.olamileke.dev) (done)

Bots
- FactsonFactsBot (t.me/factsonfactsbot)
- Newsondemandbot (t.me/news_on_demand_bot)
- Politicalnewsbot (t.me/a_news_bot)

My thinking with this is that its a simple one pager application that shows the status of all the different applications outlined above. It shows a simple green or red icon depending on
if the application is currently up or down. For the different backend applications, my thinking is to expose a ping query or endpoint (GraphQL or Rest) which returns a simple status
parameter. For frontend applications, I'm thinking to build a simple FastAPI application that I can use to scrape the contents of the webpage and use that to determine if the app is
up or not. Actually, no need for that. I can just download the HTML and inspect the HTML for some specified text.
