Monitoring Bot Plan

What exactly am I building ?
I want to build a Telegram bot that I can use to monitor my different applications and their uptime. What I basically want it to do is to query the /ping endpoint of the different 
applications and message me three times daily to let me know whether the application is up or not. I also want it to check the SSL certificates expiry of the different certificates
start alerting me when the certificates are less than 10 days to expiry.

Basically, it should trigger the notifications and check at 10am and 10pm.

I also want to be able to check for uptime and expiry for specific applications, via specific commands.
