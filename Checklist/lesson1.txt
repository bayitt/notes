Leke remember that the class autoloader function is the spl_autoload_register() function and it takes a function/method as the parameter. That function takes a 
paarameter which is the classname

Leke take note that with namespaces it is a forward slash like '/', and in the class autoloader we use str_replace to convert it to '\'

The preg_match() function takes three parameters, the regular expression, the route and the matches array which represents the array of things matched

Note that with the routes there are two possiblities, either I specify the particular route that I want and explicitly specify the controller and action.
Or I specify the format that I want like {controller}/{action} and this becomes the 

Breaking Down the Routing Process
1) We create the Class Autoloader that is the spl_autoload_register() function which takes a function as a parameter
2) Then we need to create our Core Router 
3) Then we create two arrays, the $routes array and the $params array
4) Then we create an add() method in which we sort out the regular expressions stuff and enter the route into the routes array
5) But there are two different circumstances, either I specify the route explicitly in whic case I enter the controller and the action
6) Or I specify the format of the route such as {controller}/{action}, in which case the controller becomes whatever I specify whatever I specify in {controller}
7) The action also becomes whatever I specify in {action}
8) Then I need to create a match method
9) In the match method, I am looping through the routes array and check each route against the user entered url
10) If the route is matched, then it is of two different circumstances like I specified earlier before

Leke take note that the __call magic method takes two parameters, the method name and the args
Also, we need to call the action making use of the call_user_func_array(), which takes two parameters, an array containing this and the method and the args

Leke remember that each word in a controller has to begin with a capital letter, while the first letter in an action has to begin with a small letter

Leke the is_callable() method takes an array containing the controller object and the action
