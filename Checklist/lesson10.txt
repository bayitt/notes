Leke remember that with the twig templating Engine, that in order to extend templates, we need to specify the {% block body%} {% endblock %} and then 
in the extended template, we need to extend the template as the first thing that we need to do

Leke remember that by default, any data that we try to send by ajax is converted into a string, so in order to send any DOM content we need to set processData to false,
essentially to tell jquery that it should not bother trying to send the data as a string
