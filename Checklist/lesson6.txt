The whole idea behind making use of smtp is that we call $mail->isSMTP(), then we specify $mail->Username, $mail->Password, then we specify $mail->Port 
and finally call $mail->send

The $mail->AddEmbeddedImage() method takes two parameters,the name of the image and the cid of the image so that in our HTML body
in our img we can just set src to cid to whatever the cid that we specified

Breaking Down The Login Process
1) In our login controller, we have a create method that calls an authenticate method in our model
2) We pass the entered email and password as parameters to the authenticate method
3) In the authenticate method, we call a findUserByEmail() method which verifies that the email which the user enters is correct or not
4) If the email is correct, then it returns a user object
5) Then we call the password_verify() function which takes two paramters, the passed in password and the hashed password from the database

The whole idea of login is predicated on the fact that there exists a session variable called user_id that is set to the user's unique id.
We also need to call session_regenerate_id(true) to prevent session fixation attacks

6) Then we need to have a logout method in the auth class that destroys the session
7) We also need to have a getUser() method that checks if the user is currently logged in. It does this by checking if the session user_id variable is set
8) Then in our home controller for the home page, it checks if the user is currently logged in by calling the getUser() method of the Auth class.
9) If the user is logged in it displays a different view
