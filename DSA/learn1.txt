Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out. A good example of a queue is any queue of customers for
a resource where the customer that came first is served first. The difference between stack and queues is in removing. In a stack, we remove the item most recently added while in a queue
we remove the item least recently added

Binary Search Tree
This is a node based binary tree data structrure which has the following properties
- The left subtrees of a node only contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
- The right subtrees of a node only contains nodes with values greater than the node's keys


Space Complexity is the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program including the space of input values for execution.

The best algorithms have the least space complexity. The lesser the space used, the faster it executes

Similar to Time complexity, Space complexity also plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of an algorithm or program. If an algorithm takes a lot of time, you can still wait,
run/execute it to get the desired output. But if a program takes up a lot of memory space, the compiler will not let ypu run iy.

The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of its input
