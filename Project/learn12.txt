We can make use of the Root Mean Square Error, to determine how far away our predictions are from the avtual error

There is a shortcut for calculating our slope. This shortcut is 

B1=corr(x,y) * stdev(y)/stdev(x)

Where corr(x,y) is the correlation between x and y and stdev refers to the standard deviation for a variable.
Correlation, also referred to as Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of how related two variables are in the range of -1 to 1.

A value of 1 indicates that the two variables are perfectly positively correlated meaning that they both move in the same direction and a value of -1 indicated
that they are both perfectly negatively correlated, when one moves the other moves in the other direction.

Standard deviation is a measure of how much on average the data is spread out from the mean

In machine learning, the coefficients are called costs. 

With gradient descent, each stage, the coefficients are updated using the equation

w = w - alpha * delta

w=weight/coefficient
alpha=learning rate
delta=

One pass through the training dataset in machine learning is called an epoch

Logistic Regression is the go to method for binary classification problems
