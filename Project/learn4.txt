Supervised learning is the most common sub branch of machine learning today. Supervised machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by example
When training a supervised learning algorithm, the training data will consist of inputs matched with their outputs

Supervised learning can be divided into two categories, Classification and Regression

Classification
During training, a classfication algorithm will be given data points with an assigned category. The job of a classification algorithm is then to take an input value
and assign it a category that fits into the training data

Popular Classification algorithms are 
- Linear Classifiers
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Random Forest

Regression is a predictive statistical process where the model attempts to find the important relationship between dependent and independent variables. The goal
of a regression algorithm is to predict a continuous number such as sales, income and test scores. 

For simple regression problems with only one feature, the model predictions are represented by the line of best fit. For models using two features, the
plane will be used

Popular Regression algorithms are 
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

Unsupervised learning on the other hand is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to
work on its own to discover information. They enable the performance of more complex, processing tasks compared to supervised learning, however, it is more
unpredictable compared to other machine learning methods.

Unsupervised learning is further grouped into clustering and association problems
