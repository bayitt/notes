Lists
In order to add an item at the specified index, we make use of the insert() method
There are several ways of removing items from lists

The remove() method removes the particular item passed in as a parameter
The pop() method removes the specified index or if no index is not specified, it removes the last item
The del keyword removes the specified index or can be used to delete the entire list completely

The clear() list empties the list completely

The pop() method returns the deleted item

In Python, we cannot just assign a new list to an old list. This is because the new list would simply become a reference to the old list, a shallow copy in essence.

In order to do this rather, we are advised to either make use of the built in copy method of lists or make use of the list constructor

The sort() method like it sounds sorts a list
The reverse() method like it sounds also, reverses the list
The extends() method, is like the append() method for lists
The count() method returns the number of times that an item appears in a list
The index() method returns the index of the first time an item appears in a list

Python works in a different way to Javascript, with Javascript I can easily mutate a data structure one time. But with Python, I actually have to mutate
the data structure itself

With dictionaries, we can either make use of the index to obtain values from the dictionary or we can make use of the get() method and pass in the key

If we loop through the dictionary normally, it would loop through all the keys. If we want to loop through the dictionary values, we loop through
dictionary.values(), if we loop through dictionary.items(), we can get the keys and values

Also, in order to copy dictionaries, we make use of the built in copy method on the dictionary or the dict constructor. Finally, we make use of the
pop() method to delete items from the dictionaries

Classes in Python are created with the class keyword. In order to create objects in Python, just create a variable and assign it to the class, but unlike in
PHP and Javascript, there is no new keyword before the class name
