Clustering and association are the two types of unsupervised learning

Clustering deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data. Clustering algorithms will process your data and find
natural clusters in them

Different types of clustering
- Exclusive (partitioning)
In this clustering method, data are grouped in such a way that one data can belong to one cluster only. An example is K-means 

- Agglomerative 
Here, every bit of data is a cluster on its own

- Overlapping
In this technique, fuzzy sets are used to cluster data. Each data point may belong to two or more clusters with different degrees of membership.
Data will be associated with an appropriate membership value.

- Probabilistic
This technique uses probability distribution to create the clusters


Hierarchical Clustering
This is an algorithm which builds a hierarchy of clusters. It begins with all the data which are assigned to a cluster of their own

K-Means Clustering
This is an iterative clustering algorithm which helps you to find the highest value for each iteration. Here, the data points are clustered into k groups.
A larger k means smaller groups with more granularity, a larger k means larger groups with less granularity. The output of the algorithm is a group of labels.
It assignsn 

This is further divided into Agglomerative clustering and Dendrogram

K-Nearest Neighbor
This is the simplest of all machine learning classifiers. It differs from other machine learning classifiers in that it does not produce a new model. It's 
a simple algorithm which stores all available cases and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure.
