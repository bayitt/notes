Remember Angular's interpolation syntax {{}}

Leke take note that templateURL != template

By default, anytime we call ng generate component name, Angular generates a html tamplate for the component, we can override it with the -it extension

Instead of declaring variables, they should be initialized inside the constructor


export class Hero{
	
   constructor(public id:number, public name:string) { 
	
   }
}

The text between the interpolation braces is usually a template expression that Angular first evaluates and then converts to a string

Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text

Template Expressions

The expression context is typically the component's instance

Order of precedence
Template Variable name
Directive's context object
Component's member names


template statements are essentially methods called in the component's class

statement context also refers to the component's current instance

Leke remember that template reference variable != template input variable


Leke remember that template input variables are like the variables in a loop
