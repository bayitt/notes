Angular Recap
The two types of data bindings in Angular are property bindings and event bindings

With property bindings, we are binding from a component's property to either a DOM element, a component's property or a directive's property

So in Angular, with interpolation bindings, what is being binded is called a template expression, it is this template expression that will be evaluated

Then we have things called template reference variable, and we use it to reference DOM elements in Angular, and we also have things called template input
variables which are the variables in things like an *ngFor, when we have let hero of heroes, hero there is a template input variable

Then with variables, there is an order of precedence with template variables taking the most precedence, directive variables and component variables having the
last order of precedence

Then, with event bindings, the expression on the right hand side is called a template statement and there is an expression context for both template variables
and template statements, and that is the instance of the component class.

Also, Angular deals with DOM properties and not attributes
