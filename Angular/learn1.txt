Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular Applications. They display data on the screen, listen for input and take action based on that input

As part of the initial app, the CLI created the first component by default called the root component and it is located in the src\app\app.component.ts

Essentially, the data is more or less generated in the component and then displayed in the html 'view' and it must be escaped

{{}} - Angular's interpolation binding syntax

ng generate component -  This is used to create new components

What this does is it creates a heroes folder in the src/app folder. It looks like each component will have its folder in the .src/app folder

Components have three files, its html file, css file and typescript file

@Component is a decorator function that specifies the metadata for the Angular component

the metadata that the CLI generates for the component is selector, templateURL and styleURLs

The styleURLs is an array because you can have multiple styles for the same HTML page

ngOnInit() is a lifcycle hook, Angular calls ngOnInit() shortly after creating a component 

You know how components are seperate, so you can take them as like tags with the selector that you specified in the @Component decorator
that we used to  specify the metadata for the Angular component

Angular uses the . operator to grab properties in objects, much like twig

Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts , dates and all that

[(ngModel)] is Angular's two way data binding syntax

Know how some of our Component MetaData is specified in the @Component decorator.

Another place where crucial metadata is stored is in the @NgModules decorator
