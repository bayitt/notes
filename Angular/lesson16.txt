Leke, you know that there are other HttpClient Methods such as put(), which is used to update data and post, which is used add data

The HttpClient.put() method takes three parameters, the URL, the hero object or whatever object and HttpHeaders

HttpHeaders essentially is an object in which we specify the headers which essentially is specifying the Content-Type is to be application/json

The tap() method essentially is the opposite to the catchError() method, and essentially it enables us to have access to whatever object or whatever
is returned from the http request. If nothing is returned or we do not need it, we can just type an _

The as keyword, can be used to create objects from like things that are not objects of the native class

The filter() method loops through every item or object in an array and creates another array of items/objects that satisfy the condition

Observables do nothing until something subscribes to it

The whole idea is that because put() is changing data on the server, we are not returning a Hero Observable, unlike when we are posting data to the api

const httpOptions={
   headers=new HttpHeaders({'Content-Type':'application/json'})
}

The reason why it is working like that is because I have put the [(ngModel)] to enabble twi way data binding

the typeof keyword in Typescript is used to return the data type of the element or object by its side

Breaking it all Down

http requests in Angular always return Observables, we then have to subscribe to these Observables in order to get the data or perform some computation on it

Leke remember that the filter method loops through all the values in an array and only returns the values that satisfy the condition specified

Just like we have the (click) event, we also have the (input) event to which we can attach a function

In Angular heroes !== heroes$. heroes is a normal object while heroes$ is an Observable

The async pipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so that we do not have to call subscribe() on the Observable in the Component's class
