There are three different situations

- Make everything lowercase
- Make it title case

In order to add classes in Javascript, we would need to make use of [className]=class. This is equivalent to using the normal class=

We can even do [className]="condition ? 'class1' : 'class2'". This essentially is the ternary operator

Leke take note that anytime we make use of Angular to insert classes, the class names themselves must be enclosed in single curly braces

Instead of using [className], we can make use of [ngClass] to add static classes, we can also make use of an array of classes to assign multiple clases

The whole idea with Angular classes, is that it is not like normal HTML classes, in which we can just assign a random class to any element. The class in the
CSS has to be specific on the element

Components control a patch of screen called a view

Angular creates, updates and deletes components as the user moves throught the application

Leke take note that the @Component decorator must always be followed by the Component's classs

It is the @Component decorator that marks a class as a component 

Together a component and its template defines a view

Leke remember tha you can specify services as pertaining to only particular components but this is not recommened practice. Instead =, it is recommended to
register all our services in the root app module in the providers array

Angular pipes are used to transform data before it is displayed. Directives are used to apply logic to what is displayed

Angular supports two way data binding, a mechanism for coordinating the parts of a template with the parts of a component.
