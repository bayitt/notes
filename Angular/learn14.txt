using ngIf on a component will invoke the relevant lifecycle hooks such as ngOnInit,ngOnDestroy

*ngIf and else makes use of template referencing variables to reference other DOM elements that are to be displayed in the else block of an if/else 
expression

Leke, never forget to specify the body margin and padding to 0

The contents of an ng-template never render until its expression evaluates to true

Along with *ngIf and if/else, we can also have if/then/else. It is similar to if/else, except that we make reference to a templatevariable
which we do in the then block

All innercontent that we use in sn <ng-container> tag will be ignored
