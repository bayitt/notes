The whole idea with foreign key relationships is that

with Laravel, anytime it creates the auto increments primary key id, and by default it creates it as an unsigned data type.

So essentially, the foreign key field need to be unsigned too if not there will be a data type mismatch if you try to create the foreign key

Also, the whole idea with foreign keys is that a row in the parent table references a row in the child table, it's a relationship between them. So if there are 
child rows that reference a parent row that does not exist, an exception wuill be thrown

What exactly am I trying to do?

I want to create suggestions based on what the user is typing in.

But I dont want to do this based on every keystroke of the user. Instead, what I want to do is to autopopulate the suggestions every 
500ms if the user is still typing
