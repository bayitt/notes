For DOM Manipulation in Angular, a number of reference types can be used for this and they include 

ElementRef
TemplateRef
ViewRef
ComponentRef
ViewContainerRef

These Abstractions are accessed by means of a mechanism called DOM queries which include @ViewChild and @ViewChildren 

They are basically the same except that @ViewChild returns a single reference, while @ViewChildren returns multiple references in a Querylist object

Usually, these references work with template reference variables 

We have the ElementRef, TemplateRef, ComponentRef, ViewRef, ViewContainerRef

Template Referencing Variables => #tref

Basic syntax to a @ViewChild Decorator

@ViewChild([reference from template], {read:[reference type]});

Apparently, the second parameter read is not always required because Angular can infer what kind of varible we are referring to.

ElementRef is a type of DOM element, essentially normal HTML element like span or div


@ViewChild([div], {read:[ElementRef

]})

There is a reason why we need the ngAfterViewInit() method because it specifies that whatever function that we put inside it should only be executed
after the the view has finished loading
