Cron is a task scheduler in UNIX-like systems, which runs shell commands at specified intervals 

If we want to schedule tasks that will be executed so often, we need to edit the Crontab 

Crontab is a file that contains a list of scripts that will run periodically

Crontab/Crontables contain cron jobs, each related to a specific task 

Cron jobs are composed of two parts. The cron expression and the shell command to be run 

php artisan make:command RegisteredUsers --command=registered:users

Cron jobs are composed of two parts, the cron expression and the command to run 

* * * * * - Cron Expression 

Each field is an option for determining the task schedule frequency and it stands for minute, hour, day of the month, month and day of the week

* * * * * - This means all possible values so the cron job is going to run eveery
