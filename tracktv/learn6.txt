Breaking it Down

Essentially what I did is that I made the sidebar component to emit an event every time each of the links are clicked.

I bound each of the anchor links's click event to an emitToggleEvent() method in the sidebar component's class. I also passed in a string descriptive of
the various links.

Then in the emitToggleEvent() method, through the previously created EventEmitter object, I emitted in the descriptive string.

Then,  in the eventual home component where I am making use of the sidebar component, I created an event binding for the event emitter object. As such, every time
an anchor link was clicked and by extension , the event was emitted , I bound it to the toggleTab() method in my home component .

For me typically, I like to see an engaging poster, title
