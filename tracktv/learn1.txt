In order to use toastr in Angular, we need to install ngx-toastr and angular/animations via npm. After installing, we need to add the toastr css file to our
angular.json file. After this, we need to head over to app module and import the BrowserAnimationsModule and toastrModules respectively.

Then we need to add them to our imports array in the @NgModule metadata object

Breaking this down

The whole idea is that catchError() ALWAYS has to return a function/closure that returns an observable

I think that the deal is that if it reaches sendFailedLoginResponse(), authentication has already failed, it is all about determining the appropriate message and/or
response
