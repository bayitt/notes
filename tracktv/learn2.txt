Angular's route guards are interfaces which can tell Angular whether to allow access to a route or not

Angular's guard are

-canActivate
-canActivateChild
-canDeactivate
-canLoad
-resolve

Angular guards work by looking for a true or false return value from a class which implements the given guard interface

Breaking down the process of sending mails in Laravel

- Create a new mail class making use of the command php artisan make:mail Name
- In whatever class where the mail is to be sent, use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail
- You also need to make use of the mail class that you created earlier
- Call the static to() method on the Mail class and call the send() method on it and pass in an object of the created mail class
