With an append_to_response query string, we can make multiple http requests using the same http object.

Instead of having to write out multiple calls, we can instead do something like

I think at this stage, I need to define properly the scope of what I intend to do

But before that, why I'm I doing this, I am building this because I am tired of constantly having to check when next my favourite TV shows are
airing and so I decided to automate this process

It is an application that enables you to subscribe to various tv series to receive email notifications when the next episode of the series is released

I think it should be really simple, it does not have to be a full blown application, We can have the dashboard view where you can see all yout subscribed to series

Latest Tv Series

Top Rated Tv Series

Settings

- (Tentatively) Receive either email or sms notifications
- Receive the notifications either the day before, on the day it is released or when the download link is available
- Receive download links for the episodes

Color Scheme

- Green
- Orange

I think it is important to stick to tv series, essentially limit the scope and not extend it

Only series that are currently running in can be subscribed to obviously

There is a dashboard in which you can view all the tv shows that you have subscribed to
