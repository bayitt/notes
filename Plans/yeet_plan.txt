Yeet Planning - What exactly do I intend to build

A reminder tool for stocks and cryptocurrencies. It is going to have two components, a web application and an accompanying telegram bot. The web application will
enable users to signup and subscribe to stocks and cryptocurrencies. It is essentially a subscription based system. It is going to have the following tables

- users
id - integer
name - varchar/string
email - varchar/string | unique
avatar - varchar/string | nullable
activation_token - varchar/string | nullable
password - varchar/string
telegram_id - integer | nullable 
created_at - datetime
updated_at - datetime

- stocks
id - integer
symbol - varchar/string | unique
created_at - datetime
updated_at - datetime

- cryptocurrencies
id - integer
symbol - varchar/string | unique
created_at - datetime
updated_at - datetime

subscriptions
id - integer
user_id - integer
market_id - integer
market_type - string
created_at - datetime
updated_at - datetime

The Telegram bot will enable the user to receive notifications about all the stocks and cryptocurrencies he/she is subscribed to. The user can authenticate via the bot.
To avoid having to query the database each time, once you authenticate, the user's telegram ID is added to the JSON file.

- The user can authenticate via the bot
- The user can view a list of all the symbols he is subscribed to
- The user can change their telegram details
- The user can receive notifications about their subscriptions
