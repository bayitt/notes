BackMeUp Plan
What exacly do I want to build ?
A simple application through which I can make automated backups of the storage data in my various, different bots. I am building this for my bots but I dont want to tie it too much to 
the bots. In the future I could have more applications that I desire to backup which are not necessarily bots. I want to be able to have the last one week record for backups for
the different services.

How should it work?
Everytime a new request comes in to backup information for a particular service, it needs to backup the information and delete all the information for that service which is more than a
week old. Ideally, I also want to integrate this with different notification services (bot) and/or emails which should be messaging me anytime a new backup is made. 

There also needs to be Authorization in which users can generate different tokens that they can use to authenticate the different backup requests. Another feature although this is a nice to
have is that if users can specify the specify the specific ip addresses that backups for resources can be made from

What Needs to happen
I am trying to define the actual storage mechanism. The whole idea is that it should be a unique uuid link. Something like https://backmeup-api.olamileke.me/123f-fhfh7-sjsjs-dhdhd7
The token which should be used to authenticate this request should be an api-key from the service's defined API keys

My thinking behind this notifications p is that basically users can select the notification channels that they would like to integrate with their application and also the different
actions/events for which they would like to receive notifications for. The different events can be:
- When a backup request is made with wrong credentials
- A backup request is made from an unauthorized IP address
- A backup request is successful
