BackMeUp Plan
What exacly do I want to build ?
A simple application through which I can make automated backups of the storage data in my various, different bots. I am building this for my bots but I dont want to tie it too much to 
the bots. In the future I could have more applications that I desire to backup which are not necessarily bots. I want to be able to have the last one week record for backups for
the different services.

How should it work?
Everytime a new request comes in to backup information for a particular service, it needs to backup the information and delete all the information for that service which is more than a
week old. Ideally, I also want to integrate this with a notification service (bot) which should be messaging me anytime a new backup is made.
