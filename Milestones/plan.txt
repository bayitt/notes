What eaxctly do I have in mind?
A simple project to help users record the milestones and important events in their lives. Users can either record stand alone achievements or can 
set up a project and record milestones in it.

Application Flow
The whole idea is that the user logs in, can add new stand alone milestones or new projects that contain various milestones. They can either delete these milestones
or edit them. There is a dashboard portion in which one can see an overview of various tasks and projects.
