Breaking down the process of creating the Follower functionality

1) First we need to create the migration for the pivot table
2) Then we need to set up the table schema
3) Rememeber that since it is a many to many relationship we need to have two ids
4) A follower id and a leader id
5) Then we need to create the foreign key relationships and reference the user id in the user table
