Laravel's configuration files are placed in config/app.php

The SocialAuth facade has an authorize method that takes in the name of the provider that we are trying to authorize

Breaking down the SocialAuth Process

1) First we need to make use of Composer to install the package into our Project
2) Then we need to add the Service Provider and the Alias into our app.php configuration file
3) Then we need to create the OAuth Applications on the respective platforms
4) Then we need to insert the settings inside the eloquent-oauth.php file'
5) Then we need to create a route for the social media authentication
6) In the action in the controller, we need to return SocialAuth::authorize(_

Essentially there are two situations, either the user signed up normally in-site, in which case the user does not have an avatar

Or He made use of social authenticationm in which case, the user does not have a password

Apparently Laravel has a guest middleware which is the opposite of the Auth middleware

Leke remember that with Laravel it is @extends not @extend

While working as a Community Liason Officer, we had a situation in which corp members were stranded and had no place to sleep due to the fact the facilities 
could not handle their numbers. Speaking to the corpers, I could see the anger and tiredness in their faces after undertaking such a long journey and realizing 
that there was to be no accomondation for them. I took it upon myself to find a solution to this problem and went to speak to the Community Head to tell him about the situation.
Fortunately, he offered to accomodate the corpers due to the fact that he had extra space in his compound. Upon breaking the news to the corp members, I could see
the relief in their faces.
