Laravel's authentication facilities are made up of guards and providers

Guards define how users are authenticated for each request

Providers define how users are retreived from your persistent storage

Laravel ships with several pre-built authentication controllers which are located in the Controllers\Auth namespace

The RegisterController handles new User Registration

The LoginController handles authentication

The ForgotPasswordController handles emailing links for resetting passwords

The ResetPasswordController contains links for reseting Passwords

Illuminate\Http\Request

Illumainate\Support\Facades\Auth

With Laravel, if we have custom generation loginc, we can make use of a redirectTo() method and this will take precedence over the redirectTo property

The Auth::logout() method is used to logout users

I refuse to accept that I am not good enough. Those guys that are very good at this do not have two brains

In order to grab our errors, we need to loop through the $errors->all() method and

Essentially, the sendFailedLoginResponse() method is what is called if the user does not authenticate successfully

Placeholders are similar to mixins in that, they are like reusable chunks of code that we can extend

There is a reason why they are called placeholder selectors, 

I think that the placeholder is to be used in like situations where we have two different classes that will take the same styles
