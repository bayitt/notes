You know how with Laravel, we always need to send a csrf token with our POST data so that Laravel can confir that the request is being made from inside our application.
So essentially when making ajax requests, the challenge is how to include the csrf token, and this is solved by putting the token as a meta tag and then
passing it in the headers object in our ajax request

headers:{'X-CSRF-TOKEN':$('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr("content")}

Leke take note that the trick to creatign X's is to set the element background to none

Essentially the trick to creating X's is by setting the span's background to none. And also make sure to set its position to relative to be able to
manipulate it
