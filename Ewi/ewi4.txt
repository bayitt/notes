Breaking down the process of sending Mails with Laravel

We need to create the particular Mail class by making use of the php artisan make:mail command

Then we need to  make use of the Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail facade

Then we need to call the Mail::to($user)->send(new Provider($uss))

Leke you can call the from() method on the Mail method refers to the from() that will appear in the email
Then the view() method refers to the html while the text() method refers to the plain text. Then we can make use of the with() method to pass in data
.Finally, the attach() method is used to attach files

The attach() method takes two parameters which are the path to the file and an array specifying the name of the file

The parameter that we pass into the constructor has to be a property

Essentially, in Laravel, the Auth::login() method is used to log a user in. Essentially, it is the login functionality

In the LoginController, Laravel makes use of a trait, the AuthenticatesUsers trait and this loads some functions into the class and it's a part of 
Illuminate\Foundation

Essentially the credentials() function is contained in the AuthenticatesUsers trait and it returns what should be checked to confirm if it is a registered user.
By default, it is just the email and password, but making use of the array_add() function, we can add more conditions.
