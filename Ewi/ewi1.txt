By default the Laravel User Model comes with Name, Email and Password fields

Essentially, all I have to do is to know the routes that Laravel has been preprogrammed to register new users in

In order to create database tables in Laravel, we make use of the static create() method called on the Schema class, which takes two parameters, the first of
which is the name of the table while the second parameter that it takes is a blueprint object.

The Schema class also has a rename method which takes two parameters, the first parameter is the old name of the table while hthe second parameter is the
name that we are naming it to

In order to delete tables, we can make use of the Schema::drop() method which takes a single parameter which is the name of the table while we also have the\
Schema::dropIfExists() method

While to update an existing table, we make use of the Schema::table() method, which is essentially similar to the Schema::create()

Table builder methods

$table->boolean()
$table->char('name',4)
$table->date('created_at')
$table->dateTime('created_at')
$table->double()
$table->float()
$table->increments('id')
$table->integer()
$table->softDeletes()
$table->string() - VARCHAR
$table->string('name',4) - VARCHAR WITH A LENGTH
$table->text()


$table->timestamps() adds created_at and updated_at fields to the table

In order to avoid the specified key length error with Laravel migrations. In the AppServiceProvider class, you have to call the static defaultStringLength() method
on the Schema class

So essentially, the whole idea with the auth route lists, is that by default, the routes and what they display are defined in a facade

Leke take note that the Request Facade is present in the Illuminate\Http\Request namespace
