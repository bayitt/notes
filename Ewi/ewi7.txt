Working with Request Data in Laravel

The $request->path() method is used to return the Request URI that was used to access the route

Apparently, $request->path() returns the relative URL while $request->url() returns the full URL

$request->method() returns the type of request that was used to access the route

while $request->isMethod() checks if the type of request is a particular one

Apparently, with the input() method on the Request instance, we can access particular items sent along with the Request

like $name=$request->input('name')

The $request->has() method is used to check if an item is present in the request

In order to retrieve a portion of the input data, we can use the $request->only() or $request->except() methods.

With these $request->only() and $request->except() methods, we can pass in either an array or a dynamic list of arguments

Apparently, we can only use the withInput() method to flash data if we are redirecting to another route. 

Since I am essentially returning a view, I need to call $request->flash() to make the request data available


Revising what I have learnt

With the $request->path() method, we can return the relative url, while with the $request->url() method, we can return the full url

The $request->method() can be used to return the type of request while the $request->isMethod() is used to check the type of method used

The $request->has() method is used to check if an item exists in the request

$request->flash() is used to flash the request data to the session so that it is available in the next request to the application

$request->only(), $request->except()
