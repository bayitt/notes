Data Modelling refers to the process of defining the shape and structure of the objects in an application, these objects are often called application models. Make use of the create()
method on the generated prisma type and pass in a data object to create a new database record. The createMany() query does the same thing as create() but for multiple records. Basically
data expects an array instead of an object with create(). Make use of the createManyAndReturn() method to create many records and return the resulting objects.

Make use of the findByUnique() method to find a record by its unique identifier or ID.
