Git was created by Linus Torvalds

Git is a Distributed Version Control System

SCM- Software Configuration Management, Source Code Management

Snapshot versions

Earlier, people used to work with Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCs)

A repository is a place where you have all your code

With a DVCS, on your laptop you have a local repository while on the server, there is a remote repository

Trunk Based Development 

Commit simply means save

Different web based options for git include github, gitlab, bitbucket

Readme files have a special extension called .md which means markdown

Everytime you create a new file in a repo, you are doing a commit

Commit will overwrite it

So essentially commits are on the same branch while branch means on a different branch
