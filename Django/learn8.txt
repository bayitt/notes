Basically, each generic view needs to know what model its going to be acting on. This is provided making use of the model attribute. While the DetailView generic view expects the
primary key value captured from the URL to be called "pk" so we need to make sure the route definition in the URLConf is updated to show that.

Also, by default the DetailView generic view uses a template called <app name>/<model name>_detail.html. To customize this, we can make use of the template_name attribute to tell the
view system to make use of a particular template. The ListView generic template is similar, except that the template generated has the format <app name>/<model name>_list.html.
We can similarly customize with the template_name attribute
