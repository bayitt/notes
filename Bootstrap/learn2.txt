If you want to restrict the .w-100 class to a particular breakpoint just add the .d-none and .d-md-block classes and it will remove the .w-100 class below this
breakpoint

Leke take note that there are also order-first and order-last classes that we can use to order content irrespective of how it is programmed on the HTML page

Take note that it is order-first and order-last classes. There is nothing like order-second or order-third

I have found that with almost every Bootstrap class, you can chain a Bootstrap breakpoint class to it

Leke essentially in order to add margin-left to your columns, you need to add the offset class to the column , say offset-4 will shift your column to the
right by 4 columns

You may need to reset offsets because say you say offset-sm-2. This means that from 576px upwards that element will always have a margin left of 2 columns.
This may cause a problem in your design, so say from your lg breakpoint, you say offset-lg-0

ml- margin left
mr-margin right

What I have seen is that anytime you say ml or mr-auto, what it does is that it sets the margin right or margin-bottom value to the remainder of the space

The media object is used to construct like highly repetitive media components that typically consist of an image and some text

Just enclose the overall div in a div class of media. Then put the image and the remaining content in a .media-body

Media objects can also be nested

Leke take note that on your list elements like your ul or ol. Just add .list-unstyled to remove any browser default styles

It is really easy to apply utilities to our code to toggle disaply values at certain breakpoints

It takes the same properties as the normal values of the display property which are inline inline-block block table table-cell table-row flex inline-flex

What I have seen is that the breakpoint comes before whatever value for the property that we specify

Giving a div a display property of inline-flex causes the div to become an inline flex-container. Instead of being a block element and taking up the full space, 
what happens now is that it becomes an inline flex container
