To create Bootstrap navigation bars, we make use of tha nav tag and add navbar and navbar-default classes.
Then we need to create another div tag with a class of navbar-header and in it we have a link tab with a class of navbar-brand.
Then to add links to the navbar, you need to add an unordered lisyt with a class of nav navbar-nav.
Leke do not forget that when you are creating the actual list items, that is , the navbar items, they have to be links themselves

When creating the Bootstrap dropdowns, Leke do not forget that the class is dropdown toggle, while the data-toggle is dropdown

Breaking down the process of creating Bootstrap Navbar
-Create the opening and closing nav tags with a class of navbar navbar-default
-Create a div tag with a class of navbar-header
-In it, create a button with a class of navbar-collapse and a data-toggle of collapse. Then we need to specify the data-target with a # in fron of it
-Inside the button tag, create three span tags each with a class of icon-bar
-Then at the bottom, create a link tag, with a class of navabr-brand to make it stand out more

-Next,we need to create a div tag, with a class of collapse navbar-collapse and navbar-right, to shift it to the right
-Then, we specify its id
-Then we need to create an unordered list with a class of nav navbar-nav
-The list items in it will become the links in the navigation bar
-Remember that the items need to be links themselves

-Then to create dropdowns, the link needs to have a class of dropdown-toggle and a data-toggle of dropdown
-Then, there needs to be an unordered list with a class of dropdown-menu

We also have contextual navbar classes like navbar-text, navbar-link, navbar-form
Leke to create the buttons that you usually see by the side, just use a nested div class of input-group-item
To create the button that you use to access the navbar when it collapses. For the button, you use a class of navbar-toggle

Bootstrap badges are used to create styling on numbers. Just add a class of badge to a span element
We also have Bootstrap labels, same thing as panels, label label-success, label label-warning, label label-info

Just like a class of pagination, we can also use a class of pager for the previous and next functionality
In order to use the pager for pagination, we create an unordered list with a class of pager and then we create two list items inside it with classes of
previous and next respectively
