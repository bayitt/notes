Leke, have in mind that badges can also take on the contextual classes like badge bade-secondary, badge badge-primary

Leke take note that you dont use badges on their own. Instead, you make use of badges inside of other HTML elements

Use the .badge-pill class to make badges more rounded

The way breadcrumbs work is that you give the nav an aria-label of breadcrumb and then you give the ordered list or unordered list a class of breadcrumb-item.

The active class is given to the present page that is opened. The current opened page is also given an aria-current attribute of page

It's an ordered link, not an unordered link

Buttons, much like alerts and badges can also take on the various contextual classes

While the .btn classes are designed to be used with buttons, however they can also be made use of with anchor and input elements. When making use of the .btn
classes with anchor tags designed to trigger in-page functionality, these anchor tags should be given a role of button

In order to remove the background color on buttons, insread of making use of like btn btn-primary or btn btn-info, what you should use should be
btn btn-outline-primary or btn btn-outline-info. What this does is to set the color and border of the button appropriately

.btn-sm for smaller buttons, .btn-lg for larger buttons

Create block level buttons, that occupy 100% of their parent element by adding .btn-block class

Buttons have a darker look when they are clicked. This look can be replicated by adding a class of .active and setting the aria-pressed attribute to true

Make buttons appear inactive by adding the disabled attribute to a button

<button type='button' class='close' data-dismiss='alert'>
	<span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
</button>

Set the data-toggle attribute to button to toggle a button
