In Bootstrap 4, inputs and labels are sibling elements rather than having inputs inside of labels. One must also make use of the for and id attributes to
relate the two together	

Just like we can make use of the .form-inline class to get our form elements to be on the same line, we can also make use of the .form-check-inline class
to get our checkboxes and radios to align horizontally

Since Bootstrap applies display:block and width:100% to all form-controls,by default form elements stack vertically

Instead of making use of .row, we can make use of .form-row, a variation of the standard grid row that overrides the default column gutters for tighter 
and more compact layouts

Typically, only use .row when you intend to partition form elements. If not, just make use of the default .form-group because this will take up all the space
because of display:block and width:100%

Whenever you want to create horizontal forms, you need to add the .col-form-label class to your label to center it vertically

Take note of the .custom-select class to style select elements instead of using .form-control

There are two different situations with forms, either we enclose the .form-group classes inside the .form-row class so that we can have as many 
different form groups inside of a row, or we add the .row class to the .form-group class so that instead of having our labels on top of our inputs, we can have
them side by side

Anytime we are creating horizontal forms, we need to make sure that we use the .col-form-label class to make sure that our labels are properly vertically centered
with their associated form controls, also we can make use of the .col-form-label-sm or the .col-form-label-lg classes to create smaller and larger 
form labels respectively

Apparently, the .row and the .form-row classes are by default flex elements meaning that we can make use of the flexbox utilities with them automatically

Also, take note that the .form-inline class only applies from the sm breakpoint and above, meaning that below 576px, the form elements default to stacking on top
of one another

The .custom-select class, will add a different kind of styling for the select element

Block level help text in forms can be created using .form-text

Just like we can make use of the .col-form-label-sm or .col-form-label-lg we can also set sizes for custom selects, such as .custom-select-sm or 
.custom-select-lg for smaller and larger select elements respectively
