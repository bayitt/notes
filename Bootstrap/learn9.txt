Apparently, there are also border contextual classes, that we can make use of to set the border of components, such as .border-primary, .border-secondary,
.border-success, .border-danger

Apply the .bg-transparent class to remove background color

Leke remember that you make use of .card-text whenever you want padded content inside of .card-body

Just like with .btn-group, anytime you make use of .card-group, the cards will line up and attach themselves much like buttons do inside of .btn-group

If you don't want the cards to line up, make use of .card-deck

The collapse Javascript plugin is used to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are mapped to specific elements that you toggle

Collapsing an element will animate its height from its current value to 0

You can either use a link with the href attribute or a button with a data-target attibute

Essentially, whatever element that you want to collapse, you need to give it a class of collapse and a unique ID

Then you need to set either set the href attribute of the anchor link to the id of the collapsed div or you set the data-toggle attribute of the button to the
collapsed div id

Leke NEVER EVER forget the data-toggle attribute which you must set to collapse. Also DO NOT forget the data-target attribute and href attribute which you must
set to the id of the collapsed div

The .btn-link class can be used to make a button look like a link, much like we have the .card-link class 

Anytime you are making use of accordions, with the collapsed div, you need to specify the data-parent attribute and set it to the id of the accordion
