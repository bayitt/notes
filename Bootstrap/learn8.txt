The Button Group enables us to group a series of buttons together on a single line with the button group

For a basic example, wrap a group of buttons with the .btn class in a .btn-group div

We can also make use of the .btn-toolbar class to group together a group of .btn-group

Also, instead of specifiying the button size on each individual button, we can just make use of the .btn-group-lg or .btn-group-sm

Place a .btn-group inside of another .btn-group when you want a dropdown mixed with buttons

Finally, to create a stack of vertical buttons instead of the usual way, make use of the .btn-group-vertical class

Cards are the Bootstrap4 replacements for panels, wells and thumbnails in Bootstrap3

Cards have no natural width at first but take up the width of their parent container

We have the initial .card class, then we have the .card-img-top class for the image inside of the card, then we have the .card-body, then inside of the .card-body
we have the .card-title and the .card-text

The building block of a card is the .card-body. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card

Links inside of a card are placed next to each other by making use of a .card-link while subtitles are made use of  by adding a .card-subtitle to a heading

The .card-header is used much in a way as we had .panel-header or .panel-heading

We can create list groups inside of cards by making use of the .list-group class and the .list-group-flush class, then for the li items we make use of the
.list-group-item

Just as we have .card-header, we also have .card-footer

We can even make use of Bootstrap's available sizing utilities to quickly set a card's width

.w-75, .w-50

Just like we can have images with .card-img-top, we can also have .card-img-bottom

We can also make use of our card image as an overlay, for this, we would make use of the .card-img class without the .-top or .-bottom extensions

When we do this, the image takes up the full space of the card, and then we would make use of the .card-img-overlay to place content on the image
