Many Bootstrap components require the use of Javascript to function. Specifically, they require jQuery, popper.js and Bootstrap's own unique plugins

Containers

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and re required when using the default grid system.
We can choose from a responsive fixed width container meaning that its max-width changes at each breakpoint or fluid-width meaning that is 100 % wide at all times

Bootstrap Breakpoints
- xl - 1200px
- lg - 992px
- md - 768px
- sm - 57px

Since Bootstrap is mobile-first by default, its media queries are by default make use of min-width, meaning that it is going upwards. Bootstrap also has provisions
for going down using max-width which is what I am used to

Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your content
Each column has horizontal padding

In a grid layout, content must be placed inside of columns only and only columns may be immeditate children of rows

Grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns

Columns have horizontal padding on both sides so as to create the gutters between the different columns. We can remove these gutters with a .no-gutters on the row

You can make use of col-breakpoint-auto to size columns based on thheir content instead of using like the col-md-6. Like fixed content

We can also make use of the justify-content class and specify the breakpoint and what direction you want to center the content in

We can create equal width columns by inserting a .w-100 where we want the columns to break to a new line

In Bootstrap4, in order to place items vertically, items in the row, you are going to make use of align-items-start, align-items-center or align-items-end

While if you want to align the particular column, make use of align-self-start, align-self-center, align-self-end

Leke take note that the w-100 class, its not like it sets the width of the elements to 100. Bootstrap will still display the elements either according to the
widths that you have given it or according to the number of rows. Using .w-100 just forces the row to go the next line
