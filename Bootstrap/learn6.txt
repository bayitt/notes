We make use of the .table-bordered class to create borders on all sides of the table and the cells

We also make use tof the .table-borderless class to create a table without borders

The .table-hover class is used to enable a hover state on all table rows within a <tbody>

Add the .table-sm class to make tables more compact by cutting cell padding in half

We can even make sue of contextual classes to color individual table rows or indvidual cells

Create Responsive tables by making use of the .table-responsive class

Apparently with responsive tables and the breakpoints, its like Bootstrap 4 makes use of maximum width because the tables are responsive up to a 
certain breakpoint

Anytime we need to display a piece of content - like an image with an optional caption, conside using a <figure> tag

Essentially, the <figure> element contains  <img> tag and a <figcaption> tag. Apply the correspoding .figure, .figure-img and .figure-caption classes. Also
don't forget to add the .img-fluid class to the image to make it responsive and the .rounded class if you intend for the image to have a border radius

When creating alerts, don't forget to make use of the role attribute

We have alerts for all of the contextual classes

Whenever you have a link inside of your alert, make use of the .alert-link class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert

Use .alert-heading to create a heading inside of your alerts

Leke ALWAYS remember that Bootstrap makes use of jquery

In order to dismiss a Javascript alert, you need to make use of the Bootstrap js file

I think it is preferable to close an alert with the data attributes

<button type='button' class='close' data-dismiss='alert' aria-label='close'>
	<span aria-hidden='true'>&times;</span>
</button>
