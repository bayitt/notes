We can also prevent text from wrapping in Bootstrap with a .text-nowrap class

With longer text that exceeds the width of its container, instead of using .text-nowrap, we can make use of the .text-truncate class

.text-lowercase
.text-uppercase
.text-capitalize

There are also several important font classes such as font-weight-bold, font-weight-normal, font-weight-light , font-italic

We can also change our selection to the monospace font stack with the .text-monospace class

Apparently Bootstrap has several default colors among which are
- primary
- secondary
- success
- danger
- warning
-info

Bootstrap also provides contextula .text-dark, .text-white, .text-body

We also have .text-white-50 and .text-dark-50 classes

There are also contextula classes provided for background colors, among which are .bg-primary, .bg-secondary, .bg-info, .bg-primary, .bg-light, bg-white,
.bg-dark, .bg-transparent

For quoting blocks of content from other sources, we make us of the blockquote HTML element and apply the .blcokquote class. Add the .blockquote-footer class
to denote the person that made the quote

Also, take note that we can replicate the display flex on list items in navbars by making use of the .list-inline class and giving each of the list items a class
of .list-inline-item

In Bootstrap, always make sure to wrap inline snippets of code with <code>. Also, use <pre>s for multiple lines of code

For indicating variables, make use of the <var> tag

Make use of <kbd> tag to indicate input that is typically entered by the keyboard

For indicating sample output from a program, make use of the <samp> tag
