Bootstrap Recap

Take note of the following classes as regard Bootstrap cards. Cards are the replacement for panels in Bootstrap 3

.card, .card-img-top, .card-img-bottom, .card-body, .card-title, .card-subtitle, .card-text, .card-img, .card-overlay, .card-link

Also, when making use of the collapse plugin, if you are making use of an anchor tag, you want to use the href attribute to target the collapse div. If you are 
making use of a button, you want to make use of the data-target property. With both, never forget to set the data-toggle property to collapse

When making use of accordions, always set the collapsed div's data-parent property to the id of the accordion

With Bootstrap forms, Leke remember .form-group to separate form elements
Then we have the label whose for attribute we use to specify the input of the form

Then we have the inputs that take the .form-control class

There is also .form-text class we can use for text contained in the form

Whenever you have checkboxes, give the .form-group div an additional class of .form-check and then give the checkbox a class of .form-check-input

The corresponding label must have a class of .form-check-label

Textual form elements, like inputs, selects and textareas are styled with the .form-control class

For file inputs, instead of .form-control, give it a class of .form-control-file

You can also set the heights of the inputs, by giving it a class of .form-control-sm or .form-control-lg. Note that this classes are added after giving the 
form element the initial class of .form-control

Add the readonly attribute to the input to prevent the modification of the input's value

If you want to preserve the default styling and still have the form element as rreadonly , make use of the .form-control-plaintext class

The .form-inline class works just like the .list-inline class does

Default checkboxes and radios are improved upon in Bootstrap 4 with the help of a single class, .form-check
