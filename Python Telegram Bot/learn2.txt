There are two different kinds of APIs for developers. The Bot API and the Telegram API

The Bot API allows you to connect bots to their system. Telegram Bots are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up.
These accounts serve as an interface for code running somewhere on your server.

Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests

Bots can be used to 
- Get customized notifications and news
- Integrate with other services
- Accept payments from Telegram users
- Create custom tools
- Build single and multiplayer games
- Build Social services

The whole idea essentially is that the request => your code => Bot API => Telegram API

Commands present a more flexible way to communicate with your bot. The syntax for commands is /command. Commands must always start with the / symbol
and may not be longer than 32 characters. Commands can use letters, numbers and underscores

Messages that start with a slash are always passed to the bot(along with replies to its messages and messages that @ the bot)

Global Commands to the Bot
/start - This begins interaction with the user
/help - This returns a help message e.g a short text about what your bot can do and a list of commands
/settings - Returns the bot's settings for this user
