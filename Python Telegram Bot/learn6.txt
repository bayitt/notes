RecordIt Plan

A simple application to record attendances for chaplaincy meetings. The whole idea is that we have to load in the excel file containing all the names of the 
stewards. Through this, we can see the names of all the stewards and their attendance status. 
Then, the major feature, we can search for steward names and mark them as present. 
Then, at the end, we can download a new excel file of all the stewards that are present, ready to be used tomorrow.
