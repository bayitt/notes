Final Year Project Plan

The idea is to have three different bots. The first two bots will be used to test out the main bot. 

The first bot, politicalfactsbot will send the user a new political article every hour. 
The second bot, will send the user various posts from my sample.

The third bot, and the most important one is the FactsOnlyBot. 
You can send this bot various quotes or facts and it will fact check them. You can also add it to groups and it will try to moderate content being said in the 
group. 

It will look out for various keywords such as politics, government and upon spotting them. Apply its fact check mechanism to them
