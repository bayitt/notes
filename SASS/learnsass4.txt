Placeholder selectors are like for from containers, tpo sub-containers to content

Leke #main div%blue

.sign
{	
    extend %blue;
}

Placeholders are like classes, reusable code

The @content keyword enables us to create a mixin that accepts a block of code. With normal mixins we will be calling the function with a parameter but
with this mixin we will call it with a block of code

We can also extend our sass and tell it where to create files

Breaking down the entire process, With Compass, we don;t have to manually say sass-watch, All we need is our config.rb file and we can then say compass watch and it
will create the file in our css folder

Sass globbing enables us to grab all the files contained in a folder

In order to install singularity grid system just type gem install singularitygs while to install globbing just type gem install sass-globbing

The same way that I would link to the bootstrap css or js file is the same way that I would just @import 'singularitygs'

Gutters are like the margin or space we have between the grid items

For singularity we need to import the file and then we need to include the mixin grid-span() which is built in and comes with singularity
grid-span() takes two attributes. The first value represents the number of grids while the second value represents where it should start from

Asymmetric grids enable us to build grids only the things that we need and we do it proportionally
