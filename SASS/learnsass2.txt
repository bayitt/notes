@import enables us to reference another stylesheet. The way that I was trying to combine stylesheets that time from adminbase.
I could have just said @import 'newpostresponsive'. Leke take note that the file extension is not included

You know we have pseudo elements in css. With sass rather than saying .circle:hover. Inside the css for .circle We can just say &:hover{ }.
Its much like nesting your sass essentially

Sass also has an each function

With sass, we can create arrays and loop through them much like we would do in any other language

Just like all the other sass keywords, we make use of the @prefix

like @each $social in $icons
{
   .#{$social}
   {

	background:url('Icons/#{$social}.png') no-repeeat;
   }

}

What the nth function in lists does is that it grabs the particular list item that you want 

Sass also has a built in rgba() function that enables us obtain the rgba value of a hex which is not possible with css
It also has a fade-out function that essentially makes the element transparent or sets the color to transparent

There is also a built in percentage function that we can make use of to like find relative values 

Another one is round and what it does is that it rounds a value to the nearest whole number
