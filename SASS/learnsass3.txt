What have I learnt so far from Sass

1) Sass Variables are declared at the top of the scss file
2) When you add a value to a color, you are making it darker
3) Then I also learnt about nesting sass, so that we can avoid situations like header nav ul li a
4) I also learnt about mixins. They are created with the @mixin keyword and then the mixin name and the parameter and the mixin body
5) Mixins are called with the @include keyword
6) Then I learnt about the @extend keyword, which is used to avoid code duplication
7) There is also the @import keyword which we use to import other scss files
8) Then we have the parent reference through which we can refer to pseudo elements by making use of &:
9) Then I learnt about lists in sass and looping through them with the @each keyword
10) Then I learnt about the nth function and how we can use it to grab a particular value from a list
11) Finally, I learnt about some of sass's built in functions which include the rgba() function by which we can set the opacity of hex values which is
something we cannot do with regular css
12) There is also the percentage() function which obtains a percentage value of a calculation
13) Finally, we have the round() function which rounds a value to the nearest whole number

In order to create functions in sass, we need to make use of the @function keyword. In order to return something from a function we make use of the 
@return keyword

Sass has a built in function called lighten that takes a color value and lightens it by a percentage value that you specify
There is another built in function called lightness that returns the percentage representing the lightness of a color

There is a corresponding darken() function to lighten

Sass has different output styles.

We can set it by doing the usual sass --watch style.scss:style.css --style expanded. This changes the stylehsheet into an expanded format

There is also the compact style. Finally we have compressed which is like the minified version of stylesheets. On the same line

For loops in Sass have the format @for like @for $i from 1 through 4
