Express JS recap

So we carry out validation in Express making use of the express-validator package. Typically, we destructure a method representing the part of the request that we
intend to validate. We can make use of body to validate the request body, headers to validate the request headers, cookies to validate the cookies.
We can also make use of check to validate the entire request

We can make use of isLength({min  }) to validate length. isURL() to validate urls, We validate by an array of validators that resolve into validators..
We also have .isEmail(). We can also chain an optional() method to it. We can also write custom validators by making use of the custom method and pass in 
an arrow function. The arrow function takes in two parameters, the value of the field and an object from which we can destructure the request object.

Then for multipart/form-data, express makes use of the multer package. We need to make use of multer() and pass it into a middleware. To make use of multer, 
we need to pass in a configuration object to it. We need to pass in a storage key and a fileFilter key. For the storage key, we need to pass in a property in which 
we are going to store multer.diskStorage() to which we are going to pass in an object containing destination and filename keys.

To destination we are going to pass in an arrow function with the request, file and cb parameters. To determine destination, we can call cb() with null and the path
that we want save the file to.

To the filename, we can also pass in req, file and cb and also call cb(null, name of file)

Then, for the fileFilter we also pass in an arrow function with req, file and cb as the parameters
