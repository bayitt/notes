By default, find_all() carries out recursive searching, meaning that it checks all the tag descendants. If we dont want this and we want it to only check
direct descendants like .contents, we set the recursive keyword parameter to False. 

Sometimes you only want to find one result, if so, make use of the find() method. If find_all() cannot find anything, it returns an empty list while 
if find() cannot find anything, it returns None

find_all() and find() work their way down a tag's descendants while find_parents() and find_parent() do the opposite and work their way 

find_next_sibings(). find_next_sibling(). find_previous_siblings(). find_previous_sibling()

BeautifulSoup has a .select() method which uses the SoupSieve package to run a CSS selector against a parsed document and return all the matching elements.
Tag objects have a similar method which runs a CSS selector against the contents of a single tag.
There is also a method called select_one() which works similarly to find() and returns the first tag that matches a selector
