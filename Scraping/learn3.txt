Take note of the preetify() method on the beautiful soup object to preetify the soup text
Simple ways to navigate a beautiful soup object
- soup.title - this returns the title tag object
- soup.title.name - returns the name of the title tag object, which is obviously title
- soup.title.string - returns the string content of the title tag
- soup.title.parent.name

Apparently, with beautiful soup, anytime you want to access the p or a object or essentially any type of tag in it, it returns the first occurence of that
tag in it. We can also make use of the find() method. It works much the same way as passing in a second keyword parameter to the find_all() method

BeautifulSoup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree of Python objects. But you will only have to deal with four kinds of objects.
Tag, NavigableString, BeautifulSoup, and Comment

A Tag object corresponds to an XML or HTML tag in the original document.
We can access a tag object's attribute dictionary by making use of .attrs.
