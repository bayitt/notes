Leke, in order to install Laravel, we make use of the command composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel TrackTvBE "5.6*"

artisan is a php command that comes with laravel that enables us to do things like viewing our application in the browser and create fast classes and generate
stuff rapidly

Laravel is an MVC Framework

You know how, you go about creating your our own Router, all that long journey, with Laravel, all you need to do is to call a static get() method in the
Route class and pass in the route and a closure

Controllers are located in the app, http , controllers directory

In order to generate new controllers in Laravel, we need to make use of the php artisan make:controller controller name command

You know how when we pass a route to our router and we specify a second callback parameter which represents what we want to do, we specify an array parameter in
which we specify what controller should take over

So essentially, the deal with it is that we can handle routes in two ways, either directly from our router in which we just make use of a callback,
or through a controller in which we specify the controller and method to handle the route

Setting up of our database takes place in our .env file

After creating our database, we need to create a model that is going to interact with that database

In order to create models, we need to make use of migrations

Models are also created via the php artisan make:model command

We can also pass in a -m extra parameter, which means that a migration for the databse table we are creating

We can find our models in the Providers Table

Then we can also find our migrations in the database migrations folder

Migrations are simple classes that are going to create database tables for us

Migrations are made up of two functions, one up() function and one down() function

Anytime we run a migration, its going to run the up() method and when we want to delete the table or change something, we run the down() function

In the up() method, we have the name of the table that we wants to create, then the second parameter is a callback that contains the blueprint of the created 
table

Essentially, instead of creating tables manually in phpmyadmin, we make use of the migrations to create them
For example, we can use $table->string('todo') to create a string field in our table
