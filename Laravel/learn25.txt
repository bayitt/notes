We have Schema::create() and Schema::table() methods. We can rename tables making use of the Schema::rename($from, $to) methods.

Column Modifiers
- nullable()
- after()
- autoIncrement()
- default()
- first()

The after() method is also available, meaning that we can make use of it not just as a column modifier but also as a method.
Anytime you want to change a column, after making your change, simply chain change() to it.

Make use of the renameColumn($from, $to) to rename a column in a table. Make use of the dropColumn() method to drop a column from a table
