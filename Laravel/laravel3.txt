Revising everything learnt in Laravel so far
1) We run the laravel localhost by making use of the php artisan make command
2) We can create controllers by calling php artisan make:controller $controllername
3) Then in order to handle routes, all we need to do is to call instances of the static method get on the Route class
4) The first parameter of the get method is the route that we want to match, while the second parameter can be a callback or it can
be an array in which we specify the controller and method that are to handle the route.
5) Models are created in Laravel by means of the php artisan make:model method
6) We can also add the -m parameter to create a migration for the model
7) Migrations essentially are classes that enable us to create programatically the table corresponding to the modoel
8) After doing all this, then we need to seed the database
9) First in ModelFactory.php, we need to call the define method on the factory object and pass in the model whose corresponding table we want to seed
10) Then the second parameter is a Faker object that we are going to use to seed the database
11) Then we need to create a seeder via the php artisan make:seeder command
12) In the run() method of the seeder, we need to pass in the name of the model whose table we want to seed and the number of instances that 
we wish to seed. Then we need to call the create() method on it

Leke take note that it is php artisan migrate to successfully create the table

Quirks to take note about in Laravel
1) Objects are referenced with $, unlike with twig
2) Object properties are also referenced with a ->, unlike twig where they are referenced with a .
3) In the define() method called on the $factory object, we ALWAYS have to return an array containing the potentially seeded data
4) When passing data from the model to the view in the controller, we make use of the with() method and the first parameter is the name that we want
to use to reference it and the actual object
