Leke, the static where() method in Laravel is like the equivalent of the SELECT FROM table WHERE =


Leke you know how we use this {{}} to escape HTML content, well in order to grab HTML content, we make use of {!! !!}

Laravel has the min() and max() methods which do as you think, we can use it to grab the smallest or largest value in a field

The whole idea with disqus is that with it, we can comment universally on websites

Leke take note that whenever it is a POST request, we make use of the Request $request or request()->all().
If it is a GET request, we make use of request('query')

Migrations are used not only to create database tables, we also make use of migrations to edit the database tables

You know we have the -m field to indicate that we want to create a migration for the model and how we also have the resource field to do the same for
controllers, we can also make use of the --table field for migrations to indicate the table that we want to edit
