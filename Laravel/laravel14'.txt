It is better to make use of slugs in the routes than to use id

Laravel has a helpful helper method called paginate() in which we can specify the number of psts or items that we want to grab at once

An alternative way of passing data from the controller to the view in Laravel is the method used by Twig(The array method)

Apparently when we make use of the paginate() method, Laravel implements the pagination automatically for us

And in order to create the pagination links, all we need to do is to call the links() method on the discussions objects and it automatically creates
the pagination links

The only reason why we can call the links() method on the $discussions object is because we used the paginate() method to grab the posts from the database

Laravel has a str_limit() method in which we pass in as the first paramter, the string that we want to cut and the second parameter is the number of characters that'
we want t have


Leke take note that the {{}} is used when we are outputting content

Laravel supports smart time formatting with the toFormattedDateString() and the diffForHumans() package

Leke remember that the objects that we get from the database are objects of the models representing the tables.
So essentially we can create methods in the models and call them on these objects

Leke take note that we can queue up multiple where static methods on  a model
