Laravel also has the latestOfMany and oldestOfMany relationship methods to retrieve the latest and oldest related models of a relationship.
Also making use of the ofMany() methods, we can sort the related models. With many to many relationships, we can access the pivot table by accessing the pivot
attribute on the related model. Instead of making use of the pivot attribute, we can instead make use of the as method to name the relationship as it fits its
purpose in our application.

We can also filter the results returned by many-to-many relationships by making use of wherePivot, wherePivotIn, wherePivotNotIn, wherePivotBetween, 
wherePivotNotBetween, wherePivotNull, wherePivotNotNull.

We can also define custom models to represent the intermediate table of your many-to-many relationship

We can also query for relationship existence like
- we can make use of the has method to filter for relationships. nested has statements may be constructed making use of dot notation
- whereHas, or whereHas
- doesntHave, orDoesntHave
