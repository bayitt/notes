Laravel by default loads jquery

We don't always have to pass in the Request object as a parameter because Laravel has a request() helper method

The static first() method called on a model returns the first row in a table composed in an object

Middleware can be called in two different ways, either we call the middleware on the particular route or we can call the middleware in the constructor of the class
to safeguard all the methods in the class/controller


In order to access the data, all we need to do is to call the request()->all() method

Essentially welcome.blade.php is the view that the user sees when the page first loads

Laravel has a helper method called take() which works like a limit on the number of objects that should be fetched from the database

I think that the take() method is a query builder method

There is another helper method called orderBy() and it takes two parameters, the field that we are ordering the data by and whether asc or desc

Carbon is a PHP Package that helps us to format our timestamps in a very beautiful way

When we call the Carbon diffForHumans() method, what this does is that it formats it into an ago field

I think I understand it, the take() method is a queryBuilder method and in order to access the post data contained in it, we need to make use of the get() method

Another method that exists on the Carbon class is the toFormattedDateString()
