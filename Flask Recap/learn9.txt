Flask provides a special flash() method that we can use to flash messages, just like req.flash() in node. We can add an optional second category to specify like
danger, success, info or the likes.

Python projects use packages to organize code into multiple modules that can be imported where needed

A Flask application is an instance of the Flask class. Everything about this application, such as configuration and URLs, will be registered with this class.
Instead of creating a Flask instance globally, you will create it inside a function. This function is known as the application factory

__init__.py serves double duty, it will contain the application factory, and it tells Python that the flaskr directory should be treated as a package

g is a special object that is unique for each request
current_app is another special object that points to the Flask application handling the request

A view function is the code you write to respond to requests in your application

A blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application, they are
registered with a blueprint

from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash, generate_password_hash

When creating Blueprint objects, the first parameter is the name of the blueprint, the second parameter is __name__ which identifies the name of the file while
the third parameter is a url_prefix

We register blueprints in Flask, by calling register_blueprint() on our application factory

The check_password_hash() takes in two parameters, the password from the database and the password passed in by the user.

We can store things in the session and flask will automatically store it in the browser's cookie and will sign it using the secret_key that we specified in the app's
configuration. We can access it by calling get() on the session object

clear() can be called on the session to clear it

before_app_request is a special decorator that can be used to execute something before every request to our application
