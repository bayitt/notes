ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is a scripting language standard and specification

Javascript, JScript and ActionScript are all based on the ECMAScript standard

ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing

Transpilers can be used to compile ES6 code into ES5

Examples of these transpilers are Babel, Traceur and Closure

Essentially, with let we can limit the scope of a variable to its block. Essentially, it creates block scope variables.

Destructuring Assignment - This refers to the ability to extract data from arrays and objects into distinct variables

Generators are functions that can be paused to yield a value and then restarted and essentially, ran as many times as possible

Essentially transpilers are used to conver syntax written in another language into Javascript. They can be said to target Javscript

Essentially, with let, anytime we make use of variables, we are making use of their values in that particular scope

And Leke, remember that this is for the block level, blocks essentially refer to loops, selection statements

Know how in php, we declare the constructor with public function __construct(). In Javascript it is declared with Constructor()

With Javascript methods, we can do away with the access specifiers and the function keyword so instead of having public function register() like 
we would have in PHP or Java, we can just call define register()

In order to create static methods, all we have to do is to use the static keyword

And also, with Javascript classes, properties do not have to be implicitly created before they can be assigned. In fact when they are assigned is when they are 
created, 

Also, classes can be inherited by making use of the extends keyword

It appears to me that by default the child classes's calls super() already
