Some of the new Features in ES6 include
Javscript let
Javascript const
Exponentiation(**)
Default parameter values
Array.find()
Array.findIndexOf()

let I think, is similar or a better way of declaring variables, much like I would use var now

const, essentially is similar to let except that with const the value cannot be changed, const like CONSTANT 

Exponentiation essentially refers to powers , instead of calling a pow(3,2) function like we would do normally, with exponentiation we can go directly
and call 3 ** 2. Like Python or so

With array.find(), array: This represents a generic name for the array, Essentially the find() method is called on the array and we pass a function to it.

The find() method is going to return the first element in the array that satisfies the function

Array.findIndexOf()
This is similar to the find() method except that instead of returning the first values that satisfies the function, it returns the index


Arrow functions essentially are a better way of writing functions

ES5

function Add(x,y)
{
	return x * y;
}

E6 Arrow functions

const Add=(x,y)=> x * y;

Leke take note that arrow functions do not have the implicit parameter this as we commonly have in Javascript

Also, much like typical functions, arrow functions must be defined before they are used

Leke look at like this, we have the Arrow name = parameters => return statement
