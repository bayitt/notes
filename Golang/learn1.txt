Go is a cross platform, open source programming language. It can be used to create high performance applications. It is a fast, statically typed compiled language known for its simplicity
and efficiency. It's syntax is similar to C++.

Golang is used for
- Web development (server side)
- Developing network based programs 
- Developing cross platform enterprise applications
- Cloud native development

Why use Go ?
- Go is fun and easy to learn
- Go has fast run time and compilation time
- Go has memory management
- Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc)


A Go file consists of the following parts
- Package declaration
- Import packages
- Functions
- Statements and Expressions

In Go, every program is part of a package. We define this using the package keyword. In Golang, any executable code belongs to the main package.

In Golang, statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key) or by a semicolon ;.

Also, in Golang, the left curly bracket ({) cannnot come at the start of a line

Go supports single line and multi line comments. Single line comments start with (//). Multi line comments start with /* and end with */.

In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:
- int (stores integers, whole numbers such as 123 or -123)
- float32 - (stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99)
- string - (stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes)
- bool - stores values with two states: true or false

There are two ways to declare a variable in Golang, either with the var keyword or with the := sign

With the var keyword, we use it followed by the variable name and type. Like var variablename type = value.

Or with the := sign, in which case it is variablename := value. In this case, the type of the variable is inferred by the compiler from the value.
