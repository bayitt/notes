A Go file consists of the following parts:
- Package declaration
- Import Package
- Functions
- Statements and Expressions

Single line comments are denoted with //
Multi line comments are denoted with /* */

In Go there are two ways to declare variables
- With the var keyword
- With the := keyword

In Go all variables are initialized. So if you declare a variable without an initial value, its value will be set to the default value of its type.

Difference between arrays and slices is that the length of slices can grow and shrink as one sees fit.
