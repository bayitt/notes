You can access map elements by 
value = map_name[key]

Updating or adding elements are done by:
map_name[key] = value

Removing elements is done using the delete() function

You can check if a certain key exists in a map using

val, ok := map_name[key]

Maps are references to hash tables. If two mao variables refer to the same hash table, changing the contents of one variable affects the contents of the other.

You can make use of the range keyword to iterate over maps. Maps are unordered data structures. If you need to iterate over a map in a specific order,you must have a separate data
structure that specifies that order
