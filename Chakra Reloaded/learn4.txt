GlobalStyle is a new component in v1 that injects styles defined in theme.styles.global into the global styles of your app or website.

By using ChakraProvider at the root of your application, Chakra automatically renders a GlobalStyle component which reads the styles in theme.styles.global and passes the styles
to Emotion's global component. The styles in theme.styles.global can either be a normal object or a function. Inside this function, we have access to the colorMode and theme

In most projects you might find yourself repeating specific text properties (font size, font weight, line height) or layer properties (bg, color, shadow). This can be painful as your
application grows in size. Using textStyle and layerStyle props can help you keep things organized and consistent

Properties defined in a layerStyle
- color or text color
- background color
- border width and border color
- box shadow
- opacity

Basically all the different css color stylings along with box shadow and opacity

Properties defined in a textStyle
- font family, weight, style
- line height
- letter spacing
- text decoration
- text transform

Basically all the fonts along with line heights, letter spacing, text decoration and text transform

With sx you can provide any valid css to an element and utilize tokens from your theme to ensure consistency and that your are utilizing constraint based design principles when 
styling your application. This prop provides a superset of CSS(contains all CSS properties in addition to custom ones). Basically, the sx prop is like the nuclear option.

Custom CSS properties can also be defined by making use of the sx prop

In Chakra UI, the & in selector will get resolved to a unique className that is assigned the component you put sx on
