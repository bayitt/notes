What is my plan with Agape ?

A simple application with which I can send Grace (my baby) emails everyday with the message "I love you Grace, never forget that". The email's subject will be something like
"Today's Language is German". The idea is that I'll download a JSON of all the different possible languages and their translations of that saying. The issue I am currently facing is how to
persist the current counter. I need a way to store it so that every day when it sends the email, it knows which language it is grabbing next. My plan is to store the current index in a 
JSON file with the keys - index, language and date.

My intention is to expose a single endpoint which I will trigger from one of the bots, in this endpoint, I will check the next language to be sent, fetch it from the JSON of languages,
send it to Grace, trigger another email to myself that today's message has been sent. Then update the JSON of the current index in its own JSON file.

For the emails, I intend to use Resend.
