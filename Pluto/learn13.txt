Things to note

The datetime.now() function returns the current timestamp in a datetime object	

Then the strftime() can be used to format the timestamp to different date and time formats

I think it means string format time

%Y - Year
%m- month
%d - day
%H - hour
%M - Minute
%S - Second


The way I understand it is that a datetime object can be created either by the default datetime.now() method or from a timestamp using the fromtimestamp
method

Python has a built in replace method()

The whole logic behind it is that when I called datetime.now(), it returns the current timestamp as a date object. Now, I can then call the strftime()
method in the datetime class on the datetime object to format dates as I please

What exactly do I want to do?
