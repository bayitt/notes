Email Clients that support Web Fonts
- iOS Mail
- Apple Mail
- Android
- Outlook 2000
- Outlook.com app
- Thunderbird

However, web font support depends on the email client and how the web font is embedded in the email

If web fonts are not supported, it is not the end because there are fallback fonts that are going to be seen. In most cases, the fallback fonts will be
Helvetica, Arial, or a generic sans-serif font

Each email client also has a preferred or default font which users would see if your font is not suported.

Apple Mail - Helvetica
Gmail - Arial
Microsoft Outlook - Calibri
