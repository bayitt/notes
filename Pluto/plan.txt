Pluto Planning
A Flask application used to keep track of one's personal projects and ideas
Users can add ideas, provide descriptions about them and ultimately convert them to projects by working on them
Projects have a status that that marks whether they are completed or not. 

The project is going to open up to a dashboard which contains the number of projects, completed projects, and ideas along with the lates projects you are working on
There is also an ideas tab where users can add new ideas
Then, a projects tab where they can add new projects
