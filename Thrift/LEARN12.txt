Bundling tools such as Webpack and Browsify organizes and puts all your Javascript, HTML, CSS, images and everything else in between together in a handful of neat little
files to help maeke your application run smoothly. These bundling tools come pre baked into the Angular and React CLIs	

Modules is a method of organizing large bodies of code that allows the developer to segment and mentally and digest a particular part of the application.
It gives you the ability to create bits of code in one file and create code to be used in another

Building a Javascript application has more to do with minifying the current application and creating a streamlined output

Bundling tools like Webpack are merely repackaging ECMAScript in a form

A bundle is the output of a process that merges everything into a few, if not single file in the optimized manner

The Angular CLI makes use of Webpack to put all of the application's assets, Javascript, images,css , fonts and what not into something called a dependency graph

When you run Webpack on your application, it goes through your entire application and creates a code version of a dependency graph that maps out the 
requirements for a particular block of a code

Grunt and Gulp dont support images and only work with files.

The benefit of having a dependency graph is that Webpack can eliminate dead assets. Webpack eliminates this and only builds the css and images that you need
	

Breaking down the process of drag and drop Image Upload
1) First off, you need to install the ngx-file-drop module via the npm package manager
2) Take note to specify the particular version that is compatible with your angular version
3) Then, in the root app module, you need to import the FileDropModule from the library

The whole idea behind using the Intervention/Image library is that after the image has been moved to the server, then the image needs to be resized or given the
proper orientation and this is done by passing in the image path to the static make() method on the ImageStaticManager class and calling the orientate() and save()
methods on it respectively
