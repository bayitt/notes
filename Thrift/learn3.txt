In our template, we can access each form control's value and validity as well as the value and validity of the form as a whole

We can access the value of the particular form control in the template by making use of the myForm.get('name').value

This is quite neat. Apparently we can query and check if form controls have particular errors such as error or minlengh. We can do this by making use
of the hasError() method check

Instead of making use of the get() method to access the form controls, we can also make use of the controls object on the form

Just as we can make use of the hasErrors() method, we can also make use of the errors object on the individual form controls properties

The invalid state is if our form is invalid
