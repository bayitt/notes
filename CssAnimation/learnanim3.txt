Revising What I have learnt with Sass

1) Nesting in Sass
2) The @extend directive
3) @import directive
4) @mixin. Mixins are like variables that we can use for reusable code
5) @include mixin. We can even include parameters in our mixins but they are not necessary
6) parent reference which is &:pseudo property\
7) lists in sass can be created by using ()
8) the @each directive that we can use to loop through a list
9) The #{} 
10) While and for loops in sass
11) @for from 1 through 4
12) @while $i<4
13) Sass has some built in functions which include lighten, darken, rgba values for hex
14) It also has the percentage function
15) We can slo create our own functions by making use of the @function keyword and the @return keyword to return values from the functions
16) We also have placeholder selectors
17) Finally, we can make use of the @content keyword to create mixins that take parameters

Revising what I have learnt from CSS Animations

The transform property takes a property which is translate 
We can have the translateX() which moves the element along the X-axis
We also have the translateY() which moves the element along the y-axis

We also have the shorthand translate() which receives the first value as the translate along the X-axis while the second value is the translate along the
Y-axis

We also have the scale property which stretcthes the element. If it is to set to a value above the 1, it stretches the element
Also if the element is set to to a value less than -1, it also stretches the element

But if the value is set to -1, it flips the element

The same applies for scaleY
