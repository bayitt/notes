Revising Animations

For animations the key parameter first is the animation-name and animation-duration

We also have the animation-duration property which is always the first time specified in the animation shorthand if there are two values specified for the animation

We also have the animation-fill-mode property which can take two properties which are the default value none, forward, backward or both, 
Specifying backwards means that at the end of the animation, the animated element should revert to the properties that it had the beginning of the 
animation. Specifying forwards means that it should retain the properties that it had at the end of the animation

animation-iteration-count refers to the number of times that we want the animation to occur, its default value is 1. We can also set it to infinite, if
we want the animation to run infinitely

animation-timing-function means how we want the animation to proceed. It can be ease-in, which means that the animation should begin slowly. ease-out means that
the animation begins normally and slows down at the end, then we have ease-in-out which means that the animation should begin and end slowly and in the middle
should have normal speed

Apparently, the first time value is the animation-duration while the second time value represents the animation-delay

Breaking down the process of using Token.php

In the constructor, we set a null parameter, 
In the token class, we have a $token property, if the constructor is set, the $token property is set to the value of the parameter,
If not, a new token is created by calling the openssl_pseudo_random_bytes and this generates a token for us
Then we have a getToken() method that returns the $token property
Finally, we have a getHash() method that returns an encrypted value representing the token and it does this via hash_hmac() function whose first parameter
is the algorithm by which we are encrypting the token,which is 'sha256', the second paramter is the token and the third parameter is the secret key for the algorithm
