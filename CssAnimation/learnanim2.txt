Keyframes are the powerhouse of css animations

For animations the parameters are animation-name, animation-duration

animation-fill-mode can take four values, none, which is the default value, forwards, backwards and both

There is also an animation-delay property, like transition delay

With backward, you tell the elements in the animation to have the properties from the start, with forward you tell it to maintain the 
properties at the end. With both, you tell it to maintain both

We use the animation-iteration-count to control how many times we want the animation to repeat

The animation-direction property can be various values among which are alternate, alternate-reverse, normal and reverse

Essentially normal is the default way, reverse, means go in the opposite direction, alternate means go forward first, then backward
alternate-reverse means go backward first then forward and continue like that

The default value of animation-timing-function is ease

Apart from making use of all those default timing functions, we can also pass in our default timing function making use of a cubic bezier function

The animation order is animation-name time animation-timing-function animation-iteration-count animation-direction
