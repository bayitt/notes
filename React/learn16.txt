React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX, you pass a function by reference as the event handler, rather than a string.
We may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. In Javascript, true && expression always evaluates to expression and false && expression 
always evaluates to false.

In React, a key is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
Controlled components
When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler choose what to do based on the 
value of event.target.name
If something can  be derived from either props or state, it probably should not be in the state

We can make use of a special children prop to pass in children props in case we don't know what they are going to be ahead of time.
Remember Leke that it is not HTML, or Javascript, it is JSX

React makes use of a special package called axios for making api calls
The axios.create() method is the method to take note of. It takes an object inside of which we specify the baseUrl and the headers

We make use of the react-router-dom package for navigating between routes in a react app
