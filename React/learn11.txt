React Recap
The way I understand it, JSX is like this parent, to which normal dom tags and component tags are children. If the tag starts with a small letter, JSX treats
it as a normal dom tag, while it starts with a capital letter, React treats it like a component which must be in scope.

With forms, the source of truth is from the component. Essentially, what happens is that we can set in the state values corresponding to each input.

Also, in React we make use of the map() method to map elements to arrays of JSX elements. Remember that JSX elements compile down into React elements.
React elements are first class elements and can be assigned to variables, returned from functions, passed as parameters. In React, mutable state is typically kept
in the state property of components.  Note that form handler methods by default take the event as a parameter by default

The target property in the event object represents the HTML element.

In React, sharing state is often accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that do it.
State in React is reserved only for interactivity
