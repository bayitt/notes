React JSS integrates JSS with our React app to style components. It helps us to write css with JS and allows us to describe styles in a more descriptive, 
conflict-free and reusable way.

Benefits compared to using the Core JSS Package
- Dynamic Theming - allows context based theme propagation and runtime updates
- Critical CSS Extraction - only CSS from rendered components gets extracted
- Lazy evaluation - style sheets are created when a component mounts and removed when a component is unmounted
- The static part of the stylesheet is going to be shared among all elements
- Function values and rules are updated automatically 

We can define our react-jss styles by using createUseStyles function from react-jss
React JSS enables us to make use of props in our styles easily

Javascript provides a matchMedia method on the window object. The matchMedia method returns a MediaQueryList object representing the parsed results 
of the specified media query. Basically, this MediaQueryList object is what we actually use to determine when the document matches the media query,
or to monitor a document to detect when it matches or stops matching the media query.
