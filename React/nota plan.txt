What exactly do I want to build?

Nota - a simple application to make notes.

What can it do?
- Users can make notes using wysiwyg functionality
- Users can view, edit and delete these notes
- I also want to implement versioning, similar to git
- everytime the user edits and saves the note, what the user saved becomes the current note
- the user can view all the previous versions of the note
- the user can also revert to previous versions
- user can delete versions
- user can download notes
