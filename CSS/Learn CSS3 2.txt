Thing to take note of

When making use of the css properties, it is better to specify it first and then with the vendor prefixes
The border radius defines the radius of the element's corners
Leke, note that if you specify two values in your border radius, the first value specifies the radius of the top-left and the bottom right corners while the second
value specicfies the radius of the top right and bottom left corners
If we specify only one value,the value is applied to all four corners

The css property that we use to rotae elements is called transform :rotate()

In order to animate in css3, we need to make use of the @keyframes property
@keyframes spin{
	0%{transform:rotate(0deg);}
	100%{transform:rotate(360deg);}
}

Then in the element selector that we want to animate, we will specify a an animation property

animation:spin 3s infinite

The animation is either infinite or set to a specific number of times. The issue here is that the animation is not even and it slows down when its getting to the
end, so its better if we set the animtion to be linear so it will be animation:spin 3s linear infinite

In order to male use of Google webfonts, we need to import like the css file and after that we can add the link to the font whatever

In order to make use of multiple background images we just need to add a second url after the first one, it is great for positioning like logos, in whcih we can then 
specify the position

In order to make use of columns in our paragraphs to create a css-style layout, we need to make use of the column-count property which we set to the number of
columns that we want the paragraphs to be. We can also make use of the column-gap property to specify the amount pg space in pixels that we want between the 
columns, and finally we can make use of the column-rules property to specify like the border that we want between the columns

Things to note about using multiple background images, we need to place the logo first and then place the second image and then tile it
Leke, you need to keep in mind that the background position properties value does not have a hyphen between it

The clear property works when we are making use of float and we need to tell the browser to clear stack the elements on top of each other

We can even position images in the sidebar by just giving it the same class

Leke, note that a web design principle is that we always want the content to be light while we want the background to be dark

Leke, the list-style-type can be used in place of list-style

Leke, it is good CSS practice to put the full path to the selector in the CSS
