The CSS border-radius property allows us to define the radius of an element's corners
When the border-radius property takes four values, it goes in a clockwise direction
When the border-radius property takes three values, the first value is for the top-left corner,the second value is for the top-right and bottom left, while the last ]
value is for the bottom-right
When it takes two values, the first value is for the top left and bottom right corners, while the second value is for the top-right and bottom-left corners

With the border radius, we can also create elliptical corners by making use of the / symbol between the two values

With the css border-image property we can set an image to be used as the border-image of a block level element
