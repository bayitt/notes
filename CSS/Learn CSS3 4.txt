In order to create mobile resposive websites, we need to make use of css media queries

CSS Media Queries are created with the @media() keyword and it takes a parameter, like max-width and inside we specify what we want to happen if the width of the
screen goes below the value

We make use of the max-width property when we are moving from the top to bottom nut howerver we make use of the min-width property when we are moving from 
the bottom to the top

In order to ensure that the media query works for only mobile devices, we need to set the only screen property after the media query to make sure that
that css styling is displayed only in mobile devices

We can also specify a range for the media query like @media(min-width:400px) and (max-width:600px)
