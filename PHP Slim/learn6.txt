When declaring PHP attributes, it is possible to declare the targets the attributes must be used on. When the attribute is attributed with the target it supports, PHP does not allow
the attribute to be used on other targets. It accepts a bit mask to allow the attribute on one or more targets. 
It allows the following targets
- Attribute::TARGET_ALL
- Attribute::TARGET_FUNCTION
- Attribute::TARGET_METHOD
- Attribute::TARGET_PROPERTY
- Attribute::TARGET_CLASS_CONSTANT
- Attribute::TARGET_PARAMETER
- Attribute::TARGET_METHOD

Attribute classes are declared as final which prevents them from being extended

By default, it is not allowed to use the same attribute on the same target more than once. The attribute must explicitly allow it with Attribute::IS_REPEATABLE
