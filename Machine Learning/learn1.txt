Machine learning is enabling computers to perform tasks that until now have only been performed by computers. It is the process of teaching a computer system how
to make accurate predictions when fed data. It is all about machine learning models.

Data and lots of it is the key to making machine learning possible

Machine learning is just one way of achieving artificial intelligence. Alongside machine learning, there are other approaches used to build AI systems, including
evolutionary computation

Machine learning is generally split into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning

Supervised learning basically teaches machines by example. During training for machine learning, systems are exposed to large amounts of labelled data, for 
example images of handwritten figures

These systems typically require large amounts of data

Unsupervised learning tasks algorithms with identifying patterns in data, trying to spot similarities that split data into categories.
Airbnb clustering houses available to rent by neughborhood, Google News grouping together stories on similar topics each day

This algorithm is not looking for specific things, but for data that can be grouped by its similarities

Semi Supervised Learning seeks to combine both techniques. It makes use of a small amount of labeled data and a small amount of unlabelled data

The labelled data is used to partially train a machine learning model, and then that partially trained model is used to label the unlabelled data, a process
called pseudo modelling, the model is then trained on the mix of the labelled and pseudo labelled data

Generative Adversarial Networks, machine learning systems that can use labelled data to generate completely new data

Reinforcement Learning

Like the name suggests it learns from its actions and this reinforces its knowledge over time
