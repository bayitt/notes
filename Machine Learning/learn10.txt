All classes have a function __init__(),  which is always executed when the class is being initiated. When creating the __init__ method. Always make sure
to put self, as the first parameter

In order to inherit another class, we need to pass in the parent class as a parameter to the class as we are creating it. This is the version of

Standard Data Terminology

Column - This describes data of a single type
Row - This describes a single entity or observation and the columns describe properties about that entity or observation
Cell - This refers to a single value in a row and column 

This kind of data can be referred to as tabular data.

Statistical Learning Perspective

The statistical perspective frames data in the context of a hypothetical function (f) that the machine learning algorithm is trying to learn. That is, given some
input variables (input), what are the predicted output variables

Output=f(input)

The columns that the inputs are referred to as input variables while the columns that we may not have are called output variables.
If the input variables are more than one, then they are referred to as Input Vectors

OutputVariables=f(InpuitVector)

The Inut variables may also be known as independent variables while the output variables may be known as the dependent variables

DependentVariables=f(IndependentVariables)

Y=f(X)

Computer Science Perspective

A row often describes an entity like a person or an observation about an entity. As such, the columns of the rows are often referred to as attributes
of the entity

OutputAttribute=Program(InputAttributes)

Another name for columns is features

Output=Program(InputFeatures)

Models are the specific representations learned from data and the algorithms are the process for learning it.


Model=Algorithm(data)
