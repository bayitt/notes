A machine learning model refers to a mathematical function capable of repeatedly modifying its function until it can make accurate predictions when
given fresh data

Before training begins, you first have to choose which data to gather and what features are to be considered important
The data has to be balanced

The gathered data is then split, say 70 percent for training and 30 percent for evaluation

Before training gets underway, there will also be a data preparation step during which processes such as deduplication, normalization and error correction
will be carried out

The next step is to choose an appropriate machine learning model from the many available Each have strengths and weaknesses depending on the type of data

A very important group of algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning are neural networks. These underlie much of machine learning

Neural networks, whose structure is modeled after the brain, are interconnected layers of algorithms called neurons, which feed data into each other, with the output
of the preceding layer being the input of the subsequent layer

Each layer can be thought of as recognizing different features of the overall data

The network learns to recognize each component of the numbers during the training process by gradually tweaking the importance of data as it flows between the 
layers of network

The way I understand back-propagation is that at the end of each training cycle, the system is going to work its way backwards through the neural network, 
altering the weights attached to all of these links between layers

A subset of machine learning is deep learning where neural networks are expanded into spraling networks with a huge number of layers that are trained using massive
amounts of data.
