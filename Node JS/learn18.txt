There are two keys in the object that we pass in to the express-session() function,the first is the secret key, which represents the key that will be used
to encrpyt the data. The second is the resave option, which indicates that the session should only be resaved if something changes in it, which is why we set it
to false. Finally, we have the saveUnitialized key
The whole idea is that the session object is added to the request object by defauly by the express-session middleware

In order to store session data in the database, we need to make use of the connect-mongodb-session package.
Then we need to import the connect-mongodb-session package. The whole idea is that it returns a function, to which we are going to pass in the session variable
which refers to the express-session package. This is then going to return a class to which we are going to create a store object. To the constructor, we are
going to pass in an object, with several important keys. These keys include uri: which represents the connection string to our mongodb database and a collection
which refers to the name of the session collection

The express session middeware also provides a convenient destroy() method that we can use to clear the session
