MongoDB is both the name of the company that developed Mongo DB and also the name of their most famous product
In Mongo DB, tables are known as collections. Inside of each collection, we dont have records but instead, we have documents.
Mongo DB is schema less, meaning that the tables dont have to be of a particular format.
Mongo DB does not use JSON exactly but instead, it uses a variant known as BSON. Embedded documents.
BSON - Binary JSON

In Mongo DB, there are two different ways to create relations. Either nested/embedded documents or References
Typically, we try to make use of References when there is a lot of data duplication. 
Essentially, References are like the way Relations are used in Sql, with Joins.
