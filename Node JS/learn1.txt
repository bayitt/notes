Javascript is a weakly types programming language. It is an object oriented programming language and it is also very verstile.
When we say weakly typed, essentially, we mean it is dynamically typed.

Anonymous functions refer to functions that are stored in variable names 

Essentially arrow functions are like normal functions but without the function names and the => symbol

If we have only one argument for our arrow function, we do not need to include the parentheses

The map() method on arrays is used to edit the elements of the array

Essentially, the whole idea behind this is that this refers to whoever called the code that it is using it

reference types essentially store a reference(pointer) to the place in memory where the data structure is stored

The spread operator refers to an operator that takes all the elements or properties of an array/data structure and outlines them out as single elements

The rest operator and the spread operator are essentially the same thing. Where they differ is in where they are used. The spread operator is used to
pull out the elements from the array or data structure, while the rest operator is used to construct an array from the elements

Object destructuring is a concept that enables us to obtain properties from objects

Javascript will execute all your synchronous code and then execute your async code,

Arrow functions can even be passed in as function parameters

With promises, resolve means that it should return a value. That it has finished computation

Just like how we have an index.php file or index.html file, with node js, it is an app.js file 

Most functionalities in node js are not available by default
