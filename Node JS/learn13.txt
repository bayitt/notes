Tailwind's padding utilities

Tailwind's padding scale works on the +0.25 rem scale. From p-0 to p-20. It's utilities also work a lot like Bootstrap's with the pt, pr, pl, pb.
Horizontal padding works with .px while vertical padding works with py. Control the padding on all sides with p.

In Tailwind, we can also control the negative margin of an element using the -m{side?}-{size}

Width Utilities
These utilities work or have the same width as the padding and margin utilities. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16,20

Use the .w-auto to let the browser calculate and set the width for the element.
Use the .w-screen to make an element span the entire width of the viewport

The Tailwind equivalent of .container-fluid in Bootstrap is .w-screen

We make use of the .w-{number} or .w-px to set an element to a fixed width. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,16,20,24,32,40,48,56,64.

Tailwind's equivalent of the .w-100 in Bootstrap is .w-full. Tailwind is also smart enough to make use of fractions

Min-Width Utility
.min-w-0
.min-w-full

Max-width utilities
.max-w-full
.max-w-screen-sm - 640px
.max-w-screen-md - 768px
.max-w-screen-lg - 1024px
.max-w-screen-xl - 1280px

Height works much in the same way as Width, we can set the fixed width as h-0 to h-64. We also h-auto.
Also, use h-screen, to make an element span the entire height of the viewport. Use h-full to set an element to 100% of its parent.

For controlling min-height, Tailwind has similarly to the min-w-0 and min-w-full, has the min-h-0, min-h-full. It also has the min-h-screen, which sets the
min height of the element to be its viewport.

For setting the maximum height of an element, we can make use .max-h-full and .max-h-screen
