We can even specify the error message that we want to be displayed, by chaining a withMessage() method to the validation function
The check() method checks the entire request, the body, the params, the query, everything. Alternatively, we can make use of body() to check the
request body, header() for headers, cookie() cookies, params() for params. Also, if we want to repeat the same error message, instead of chaining different
withMessage() methods to the validation checks, we can just pass in the validation message as a second parameter to the body() method.

Available validation methods include isLength(), isAlphanumeric()
