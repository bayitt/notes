We can pass the show_default value to make sure that the default value is not shown in the terminal. We can also pass to the show_default a string to use to show as the show_default option
We can customize the displayed meta variable in the terminal. By default, it is the argument in uppercase. But we can customize it with the metavar argument to typer.Argument()

We can also hide an argument from displayed in the help section. We can do this by setting hidden to True on typer.Argument()

We can also configure a CLI argument to to read from an environment value by making use of the envvar parameter for typer.Argument().

We can also pass in a list of environment values that will be used to fetch

By default environment values are going to be shown in the help for an argument but can be disabled with show_envvar set to False
