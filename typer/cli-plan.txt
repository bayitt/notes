What exactly do I want to build?
A CLI tool for the Maui application

What should it be able to do ?
- Users should be able to authenticate
- Users should be able to add expenses, both for the current day and any day that they specify
- Users should be able to view expenses, by default for the current day and for any day they specify
- Users should be able to search for expenses
- Users should be able to view an overview of their maui history
- Users should be able to download expenses for a particular day, or month (tentative)

Mapping Out this User flow
- If the User types out the default command without any additional command, it tries to authenticate the user
- It opens up the login page of the Maui app
- If the user is logged in successfully, a message should be displayed telling that they have logged into the Maui CLI
- They should also get a corresponding email
- They should also be logged into the Maui CLI
