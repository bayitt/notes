Typer is a library for building CLI applications that users will love using and developers will love creating.
Typer uses Click internally. That is the only dependency. But we can also install other dependencies such as:
- colorama
- shellingham

Python has support for optional type hints. These type hints are a special syntax that allow for declaring the type of a variable.

Standard Python Types
- int
- str
- float
- bool
- bytes

To declare data structures that contain other values like dict, list, set and tuple we can make use of the standard Python typing module.
With List[str]. str is what is known as a type parameter
Dict[str, bool]

We can also make use of the Optional type to indicate that a variable or parameter can be None

The types that take type parameters in square brackets are List, Tuple, Set, Dict, Optional are called Generic Types or Generics

We can also declare our variables to be of types of a class.

CLI arguments refer to CLI parameters passed in some specific order to the CLI application. By default, they are required
If you need to pass a single value that contains spaces as a CLI argument, wrap it in quotes.

CLI options refer to CLI parameters passed to the CLI application with a specific name. CLI options are also known as flags or switches.

The whole idea with Typer is that absolutely any function param that is not required becomes a CLI option

With Typer, if we add a docstring to our method, it will automatically be used as the help text of the function
