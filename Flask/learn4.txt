If you intend to customize the error page, make use of the errorhandler decorator

Anytime you are returning a view for the error handler, you need to add the 404 error code to indicate to Flask that a 404 error indeed occurred.
If not, Flask will assume that it is 200 and all actually went well.

The return value from a view function is automatically converted into a response object

About Responses
If a response object of the correct type is returned it is directly returned from the view
If its a string, a response object is created with that data and the default parameters
If its a dict, a response object is created
If a tuple is returned, the items in the tuple can be used to provide extra information

application factory. Any configuration, registration and other setup the application needs will happen inside the function
