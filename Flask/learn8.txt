Leke take note that pip freeze > requirements.text is like package.json in Angular. It is a text file containing all dependencies

When a module/file is loaded in Python, __file__ is set to its name. We can then use that with other functions to find the directory that the file 
is located in

os.environ is a dictionary that contains all the environment variables

autoenv is a program that enabkes us to set commands that will run every time we cd into our directory

In order to use pip outside of your virtual environment, use python -m 

__file__ will give you the name of the file
os.path.dirname() will give you the folder where the file is contained
os.path.realpath() will give you the folder + file name

__name__ is a built in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module
