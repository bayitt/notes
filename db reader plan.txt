What exactly am I trying to build ?

A simple application through which I can record my blood sugar readings. I want to be able to upload a blood sugar reading for the current date and if possible for a different date
and have it recorded. I also want to be able to plot charts for the sugar readings, maybe for a particular week and a particular month. Authentication should be via magic links, no
need for a users table. This application is going to be written in Vue with a PHP Slim backend.

Tables
Readings
- id (int)
- uuid (string)
- value (int)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

Magic Links
- id
- uuid
- created_at (timestamp)
- expires_at (timestamp)
