REST API Design Tips
It is advisable to provide a version namespace for your RESTFUL API

- Use plurals for your routes
Essentially your endpoint names need to be descriptive
Query strings should be used for further filtering of results beyond the initial grouping of a logical set offered by a relationship
Try as much as possible to keep your core routing logic in the initial endpoint name

- Try as much as possible to provide flat routes for update and delete operations. Essentially, longer paths for creating/fetching nested resources.
Shorter paths for updating/deleting resources

Pagination is an important thing to do, the various ways of doing this include making use of the from query parameter

Envelope your api responses, with either data or error
When dealing with JSON, it is essential that we include an application/json Content-Type header

- When updating a resource, it is good practice to return the updated resource in response to a successful POST, PUT or PATCH request
