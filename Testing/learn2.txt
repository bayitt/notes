Continuous delivery leverages all the afore mentioned strategies to create a seamless pipeline that automatically delivers completed code tasks

Automated software testing refers to the application of software toools to automate a human driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product.

Continuous Integration(CI) is responsible for running automated tests against any new code changes and verifying that those code changes do not break established 
features or introduce any new bugs. CD is triggered once the continuous integration step passes the automated test plan

The way I see it yeah, Continouos Integration works in tandem and with Continuos delivery

E2E testing tools capture and replay user actions

Performance tests when used in the context of software development refer to the speed and responsiveness at which a software project reacts

Apparently, there is another type of test called Functional testing which is remarkably similar to Integration testing. While Integration testing seeks to
ensure that the various modules and services in your application are working together. Such as for example that you are able to interact with your database
while functional testing seeks to make sure that we are getting the right output from the databases

Acceptance tests are another type of test which is carried out to ensure that a system satisfies its business requirements. It requires the entire
system to be up and running

While our tests can be executed via script from the terminal, you can have them be continually executed by a CI server like Bamboo or a cloud service like 
BitBucket Pipelines
