One specific thing to do is to test component props

(component).props() to access a component's internal props

With Enzyme, we can execute find() operations similarly to document.getElementById(), document.getElementByClassName().
We can also check the state of components to check if an error exists in it

Snapshot testing captures the code of a component at a moment in time, in order to compare it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. It is used to keep track of changes
to an app's UI.

To convert an Enzyme wrapper to a format that is compatible witn Jest snapshot testing, we need to make use of enzyme-to-json

Make use of the toMatchSnapshot() method to test snapshots

Make use of jest.fn() to mock a function

toHaveBeenCalled(), toHaveBeenCalledTimes()

mock.mockReturnValue()
