Breaking down the process of Implementing the Remember Me Functionality
1) First, there needs to be a remember me checkbox in the Login Form
2) Then, in the Login Controller we need to grab the boolean value of if the checkbox is checked or not
3) Then we need to pass whatever boolean value that it is, to the Auth class where the whole process of logging out is carried out
4) In the Auth class, if the remember me checkbox is checked, then we need to make a call to the rememberLogin() method in the User Model
5) In the User Model, we create a token, set it to the value of the user->token property
6) Then we need to hash the token and insert a new entry into the rememberedLogins Table which has three fields, the remembered_token , user_id and the expiry
7) You know how the whole login process is predicated on creating/having a user object which is obtained from the username and email
8) But we can also have a user object based on the Remember Me functionality 
9) Whenever the getUser() method is called, if it doesnt find a user object via the conventional means, then it needs to call a static rememberedLogin
10) This method checks if a cookies exists in the browser, If it does, it passes it to a method in the rememberedLogin model which checks to see if a hashed token
exists which corresponds to the cookies set in the browser
