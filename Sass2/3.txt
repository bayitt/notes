The $_SESSION['REQUEST_URI'] contains the url of the last visited page

Breaking down the Process of Redirecting upon Login

1) We need to create a getRequestedtPage() static method in our Auth class
2) What this method does is that is assigns the current url in the address bar to a variable in the Session
3) This method is called only when the user tries to access a restricted url that can be accessed only by an authenticated user
4) This method is called after we have redirected the user to the login page 
5) Then in the Login controller after the user has authenticated successfully, when the user needs to be redirected, we call another method
rememberRequestedPage()
6) This method checks if the return_to variable exists in the Session, and if it does, it returns the URL to redirect
7) If the variable does not exist, it returns '', which means that the user is simply redirected Home
